But O
the O
staff B-A
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-A
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
uniformly O
exceptional O
, O
with O
a O
very O
capable O
kitchen B-A
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
, O
whether O
it O
' O
s O
on O
the O
menu B-A
or O
not O
. O

Where O
Gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don O
' O
t O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don O
' O
t O
get O
it O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
food B-A
outstanding O
, O
but O
the O
little O
' O
perks B-A
' O
were O
great O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

Our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B-A
with I-A
sausage I-A
and I-A
chicken I-A
( O
usually O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish B-A
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats B-A
). O

The O
Bagels B-A
have O
an O
outstanding O
taste O
with O
a O
terrific O
texture O
, O
both O
chewy O
yet O
not O
gummy O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
food B-A
itself O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

They O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise B-A
, O
forgot O
our O
toast B-A
, O
left O
out O
ingredients B-A
( O
ie O
cheese B-A
in O
an O
omelet B-A
), O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B-A
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B-A
when O
you O
touched O
it O
. O

It O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check B-A
, O
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
, O
have O
drinks B-A
and O
talk O
! O

The O
design B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine B-A
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
Mary O
' O
s O
and O
am O
making O
it O
one O
of O
my O
regular O
neighborhood O
haunts O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
the O
best O
if O
you O
like O
thin O
crusted O
pizza B-A
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

He O
can O
' O
t O
help O
, O
they O
' O
re O
bought O
up O
so O
fast O
. O

Secondly O
, O
on O
this O
night O
the O
place O
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
upper O
east O
side O
ladies O
perfume O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

Obviously O
run O
by O
folks O
who O
know O
a O
pie O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

IT O
IS O
DEFINITELY O
SPECIAL O
AND O
AFFORDABLE O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

All O
the O
money O
went O
into O
the O
interior B-A
decoration I-A
, O
none O
of O
it O
went O
to O
the O
chefs B-A
. O

The O
seats B-A
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
seltzer B-A
with I-A
lime I-A
, O
no O
ice O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
alone O
--- O
even O
two O
people O
isn O
' O
t O
enough O
for O
the O
whole O
experience O
, O
with O
pickles B-A
and O
a O
selection B-A
of I-A
meats I-A
and I-A
seafoods I-A
. O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B-A
family I-A
style I-A
because O
you O
' O
ll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes B-A
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-A
, O
the O
owner B-A
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-A
is O
fast O
. O

This O
isn O
' O
t O
a O
value O
joint O
. O

Faan O
' O
s O
got O
a O
great O
concept O
but O
a O
little O
rough O
on O
the O
delivery B-A
. O

From O
the O
incredible O
food B-A
, O
to O
the O
warm O
atmosphere B-A
, O
to O
the O
friendly O
service B-A
, O
this O
downtown O
neighborhood O
spot O
doesn O
' O
t O
miss O
a O
beat O
. O

Great O
food B-A
at O
REASONABLE O
prices B-A
, O
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
! O

Look O
foward O
to O
trying O
the O
Ruben O
upon O
returning O
. O

The O
only O
other O
steakhouse O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
Roth O
' O
s O
is O
the O
Strip O
House O
. O

We O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
anniversary O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-A
decor I-A
and O
affordable O
city O
prices B-A
. O

You O
' O
ll O
adore O
it O
. O

Two O
words O
: O
Free O
wine B-A
. O

The O
price B-A
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-A
is O
poor O
. O

The O
quantity B-A
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth O
' O
s O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O
Being O
serious O
sushi B-A
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B-A
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

Raga O
' O
s O
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

The O
fried B-A
rice I-A
is O
amazing O
here O
. O

Three O
courses B-A
- O
choices O
include O
excellent O
mussels B-A
, O
puff B-A
pastry I-A
goat I-A
cheese I-A
and O
salad B-A
with I-A
a I-A
delicious I-A
dressing I-A
, O
and O
a O
hanger B-A
steak I-A
au I-A
poivre I-A
that O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

it O
' O
s O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-A
food I-A
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
service O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

At O
the O
end O
you O
' O
re O
left O
with O
a O
mild O
broth B-A
with I-A
noodles I-A
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O
. O

I O
just O
wonder O
how O
you O
can O
have O
such O
a O
delicious O
meal B-A
for O
such O
little O
money B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
excellent O
. O

so O
garantuan O
that O
you O
can O
' O
t O
fit O
them O
in O
a O
toaster O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai B-A
food I-A
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
' O
s O
of O
course O
). O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
before O
offering O
another O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia O
pizza O
. O

Whem O
asked O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
more O
detailed O
questions O
so O
that O
we O
knew O
what O
the O
specials B-A
were O
. O

This O
is O
a O
consistently O
great O
place O
to O
dine B-A
for O
lunch B-A
or O
dinner B-A
. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-A
, O
the O
service B-A
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-A
was O
good O
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-A
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B-A
and O
had O
dinner B-A
. O

Fabulous O
service B-A
, O
fantastic O
food B-A
, O
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere B-A
and O
environment B-A
. O

Not O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
hear O
. O

Try O
the O
lasagnette B-A
appetizer I-A
. O

Pricey O
, O
but O
worth O
a O
try O
, O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
end O
up O
sitting O
next O
to O
some O
pretty O
odd O
people O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
beer B-A
selection I-A
! O

Great O
food B-A
, O
good O
size O
menu B-A
, O
great O
service B-A
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-A
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-A
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining B-A
experience O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
eating O
Dosa B-A
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
NY O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

Wine B-A
list I-A
selection I-A
is O
good O
and O
wine B-A
- I-A
by I-A
- I-A
the I-A
- I-A
glass I-A
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees B-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
carnivore O
, O
come O
hungry O
and O
you O
will O
leave O
more O
satisfied O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-A
are O
excellent O
. O

Not O
too O
crazy O
about O
their O
sake B-A
martini I-A
. O

Great O
bagels B-A
, O
spreads B-A
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

The O
service B-A
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
' O
re O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

whoever O
the O
jazz O
duo O
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
I O
never O
felt O
rushed O
or O
pressured O
to O
give O
up O
my O
table B-A
ot O
incoming O
guests O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

We O
happened O
upon O
this O
place O
purely O
by O
accident O
and O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
outstanding O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits O
. O

Deff O
recimmend O
Bukhara O
they O
also O
have O
opened O
two O
new O
locations O
guess O
ill O
try O
them O
out O
. O

We O
always O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal B-A
and O
always O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
. O

Dip O
the O
ingredients B-A
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks B-A
, O
swirl O
them O
around O
, O
and O
eat O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-A
terrace I-A
. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

Everyone O
I O
have O
spoken O
too O
there O
is O
super O
friendly O
, O
helpful O
, O
and O
willing O
to O
the O
extra O
mile O
for O
a O
customer O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

Sapphire O
is O
the O
only O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
go O
to O
when O
I O
' O
m O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
cuisine B-A
from O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
Taiwanese O
, O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
Taipei O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
in O
NYC O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

They O
are O
often O
crowded B-A
on O
the O
weekends O
but O
they O
are O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
with O
their O
service B-A
. O

All O
my O
co O
- O
workers O
were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small O
the O
dish B-A
was O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B-A
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
magnificant O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-A
branzino I-A
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
has O
gotten O
better O
and O
better O
! O

This O
place O
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed B-A
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-A
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-A
food I-A
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

This O
place O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

I O
was O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O

Le O
Pere O
Pinard O
has O
a O
$ O
15 O
pre B-A
- I-A
theater I-A
menu I-A
that O
is O
outstanding O
. O

Went O
inside O
and O
I O
started O
to O
get O
excited O
. O

I O
also O
order B-A
replaceended I-A
for I-A
replacestart I-A
delivery I-A
and O
the O
restaurant O
forgot O
half O
the O
order B-A
. O

Our O
server B-A
checked O
on O
us O
maybe O
twice O
during O
the O
entire O
meal B-A
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
Montparnasse O
many O
times O
and O
return O
often O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

The O
strong O
scents B-A
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-A
sandwich I-A
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

It O
' O
s O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

If O
you O
wrote O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
it O
' O
s O
because O
you O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
what O
Rao O
' O
s O
is O
all O
about O
. O

Had O
we O
been O
stalling O
I O
could O
understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O
from O
, O
but O
we O
had O
been O
there O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
they O
hadn O
' O
t O
even O
brought O
us O
a O
check B-A
yet O
! O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

Though O
the O
Spider B-A
Roll I-A
may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge O
to O
eat O
, O
with O
soft O
shell B-A
crab I-A
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
, O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O

both O

the O
hostess B-A
didn O
' O

or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-A
( I-A
rice I-A
porridge I-A
) I-A

Their O
tuna B-A

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
BEST O
restaurants O
I O
' O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
pretty O
decent O

An O
oasis O
of O
refinement O
: O
Food B-A
, O
though O
somewhat O
uneven O
, O
often O
reaches O
the O
pinnacles O
of O
new O
American O
fine O
cuisine B-A
- O
chef B-A
' O
s O
passion O
( O
and O
kitchen B-A
' O
s O
precise O
execution O
) O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
fish B-A
dishes I-A
and O
soups B-A
. O

If O

Plenty O

The O

VT O
is O
what O

hope O
to O

From O
the O
terrible O
service B-A
, O
to O
the O
bland O
food B-A
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
unaccommodating O
managers B-A
, O
the O
overall O
experience O
was O
horrible O
. O

Lahore O

Not O

with O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
entire O
dining B-A
experience I-A
was O
wonderful O
! O

The O
wine B-A
selection I-A
( O
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
) O
is O
wonderful O
and O
I O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B-A
if O
they O
' O
re O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O
. O

Service B-A
is O
highly O
refined O
: O
our O
seating O
was O
delayed O
35 O
minutes O
past O
our O
reservation B-A
and O
the O
maitre B-A
d O
' O
apologized O
and O
regularly O
kept O
us O
apprised O
of O
progress O
. O

Order O
the O
panang B-A
duck I-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
fantastic O
. O

Food B-A
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-A
vegatables I-A
in O
side O
orders O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
crappy O
service B-A
from O
two O
individuals O
, O
it O
' O
s O
great O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

Wondering O
who O
had O
the O
best O
deals O
we O
noticed O
a O
line O
had O
formed O
to O
wait O
for O
this O
one O
particular O
establishment O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-A
at O
amazin O
prices B-A
. O

You O
are O
treated O
just O
like O
royality O
. O

There O
' O
s O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
). O

Ambiance B-A
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
felt O
more O
unwelcome O
than O
last O
month O
at O
Jimmy O
' O
s O
Bronx O
Cafe O
. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-A
Salmon I-A
, O
Sea B-A
Bass I-A
and O
Crispy B-A
Duck I-A
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
replacestart B-A
ingredients I-A
replaceend O
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
replacestart B-A
ingredients I-A
replaceend O
don O
' O
t O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-A
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-A
right O
. O

Looking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
, O
one O
would O
hesitate O
to O
enter O
this O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
( O
really O
, O
that O
' O
s O
what O
it O
is O
). O

and O
yes O
Dal B-A
Bukhara I-A
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B-A
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating B-A
here O
again O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
as O
a O
child O
and O
always O
come O
back O
for O
the O
taste B-A
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
those O
comfortable O
neighborhood O
joints O
where O
you O
know O
you O
will O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal B-A
at O
a O
fair O
price B-A
. O

A O
glass B-A
of I-A
Leaping I-A
Lizard I-A
, O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
prosecco I-A
, O
and O
the O
mussels B-A
had O
everything O
happy O
. O

Food B-A
was O
average O
and O
creme B-A
brulee I-A
was O
awful O
- O
the O
sugar B-A
was O
charred O
, O
not O
caramelized O
and O
smelled O
of O
kerosene O
. O

The O
food B-A
always O
tastes O
fresh O
and O
served B-A
promptly O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
here O
is O
delicious O
. O

My O
entire O
family O
was O
horrified O
. O

On O
a O
monthly O
basis O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
get O
together O
and O
have O
a O
girls O
night O
out O
. O

Pizza B-A
and O
garlic B-A
knots I-A
are O
great O
as O
well O
, O
I O
order O
from O
them O
quite O
often O
and O
the O
delivery B-A
is O
always O
super O
quick O
! O

For O
great O
chinese B-A
food I-A
nearby O
, O
you O
have O
Wu O
Liang O
Ye O
and O
Grand O
Sichuan O
just O
a O
block O
away O
. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray O
' O
s O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-A
. O

This O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-A
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red O
Eye O
. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-A
. O

This O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
- O
away O
from O
customers O
. O

Service B-A
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
( O
the O
heavy O
, O
black O
, O
antique O
- O
seeming O
teapot B-A
, O
for O
one O
) O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
. O

Glad O
you O
have O
the O
luxury O
to O
throw O
out O
paying O
customers O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-A
mozzarella I-A
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese B-A
common O
to O
most O
pizza B-A
replaceendria I-A
' I-A
s I-A
. I-A

Its O
an O
excellent O
place B-A
to O
relax O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
of O
New O
York O
. O

service B-A
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting B-A
a I-A
table I-A
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
was O
crowded O
but O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bistro B-A
- I-A
type I-A
vibe I-A
. O

Check O
it O
out O

First O
off O
, O
the O
waitress B-A
was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
2 O
times O
we O
saw O
her O
( O
odd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
6 O
tables B-A
) O
and O
got O
our O
order O
wrong O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

What O
is O
even O
better O
, O
is O
that O
the O
prices B-A
are O
very O
affordable O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
really O
good O
. O

The O
fish B-A
is O
fresh O
but O
the O
variety O
of O
fish B-A
is O
nothing O
out O
of O
ordinary O
. O

Look O
I O
dont O
know O
if O
the O
people O
who O
wrote O
the O
reviews O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
a O
decent O
place O
( O
PLEASE O
TRY O
SOMEOTHER O
PLACES O
). O

Suan O
has O
challenged O
this O
loyalty O
. O

Our O
favorite O
meal B-A
is O
a O
pesto B-A
pizza I-A
, O
the O
house B-A
salad I-A
, O
and O
a O
good O
bottle B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
. O

And O
Kruno O
, O
the O
beverage B-A
manager I-A
is O
the O
best O
bartender B-A
I O
have O
yet O
to O
come O
across O
. O

Ambiance B-A
and O
music B-A
funky O
, O
which O
I O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-A
, O
drinks B-A
and O
service B-A
are O
clearly O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food B-A
and O
refleshment B-A
with O
my O
date O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
really O
great O
deal O
, O
considering O
we O
got O
full O
off O
of O
four O
dollars O
. O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
, O
alluring O
ambiance B-A
or O
the O
five O
star O
service B-A
featuring O
a O
sommlier B-A
and O
a O
complicated O
maze O
of O
captain B-A
and O

you O
come O
for O
the O
authentic O
foods B-A
, O
the O
tastes B-A

the O
only O
person O
who O

). O

My O

and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O

Last O
time O
I O

taking O
our O
order O

tandoori B-A
salmon I-A
! O

I O
am O
completely O
hooked O
on O
this O
place O
, O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-A
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

Granted O
the O
space B-A
is O
smaller O
than O
most O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best O
service B-A
you O
will O
find O
in O
even O
the O
largest O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place O
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O

( O
La O
Rosa O

It O
could O
have O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
and O
her O
suggestions O
of O
menu B-A
items I-A
was O
right O
on O
the O
mark O

It O
' O
s O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
environment B-A
is O
romantic O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
horrible O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
pathetic O
, O
and O
gabriella O
lies O
about O
everything O
she O
could O
. O

We O
had O
crawfish B-A
boiled I-A
and O
despite O
making O
a O
mess O
, O
it O
was O
a O
ton O
of O
fun O
and O
quite O
tasty O
as O
well O
. O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
for O
this O
place O
and O
made O
a O
reservation B-A
a O
couple O
of O
months O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

What O
came O
to O
our O
table B-A
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Pad B-A
Thai I-A
and O
the O
noodles B-A
were O
sticky O
. O

So O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
actually O
been O
to O
M O
proper O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
it O
delivered B-A
a O
few O
times O
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values B-A
for I-A
your I-A
money I-A
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch B-A
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-A
Mojito I-A
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Okay O
service B-A
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-A
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-A
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
just O
awful O
, O
ATROCIOUS O
actually O
. O

I O
will O
never O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
again O
. O

The O
soup B-A
for I-A
the I-A
udon I-A
was O
soy B-A
sauce I-A
and O
water B-A
. O

The O
anti B-A
- I-A
pasta I-A
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-A
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling B-A
pasta I-A
mains I-A
. O

The O
waitress B-A
suggested O
glasses B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
that O
went O
very O
well O
with O
the O
food B-A
. O

( O
or O
sister O
, O
in O
my O
case O
!). O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

They O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter B-A
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
, O
but O
their O
food B-A
says O
I O
love O
you O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-A
mix I-A
( I-A
special I-A
) I-A
, O
crab B-A
dumplings I-A
, O
assorted B-A
sashimi I-A
, O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
and O
rolls B-A
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-A
, O
and O
the O
banana B-A
tempura I-A
. O

Try O
their O
plain B-A
pizza I-A
with O
fresh O
garlic B-A
or O
eggplant B-A
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
there O
! O

Ok O
, O
so O
the O
replacestart B-A
servers I-A
replaceend O
wander O
around O
a O
little O
clueless O
, O
but O
there O
' O
s O
more O
than O
enough O
replacestart B-A
servers I-A
replaceend O
for O
the O
crowd O
they O
get O
-- O
it O
' O
s O
fine O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
effort O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
. O

Good O
luck O
getting B-A
a I-A
table I-A
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
look O
down O
your O
nose O
at O
me O
like O
that O
... O

Planet O
Thai O
is O
great O
! O

The O
service B-A
is O
awful O
. O

Just O
don O
' O
t O
do O
it O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

The O
takeout B-A
replacestart I-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded O
menu B-A
offering O
more O
italian B-A
dishes I-A
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
! O

Trust O
me O
, O
it O
will O
be O
great O
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
in O
no O
time O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O O
. O
G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
had O
one O
near O
my O
office O
- O
I O
would O
go O
everyday O
. O

Finally O
! O

Amma O
has O
the O
worst O
value O
for O
money O
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
NYC O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

I O
think O
this O
would O
be O
a O
pretty O
good O
spot O
if O
it O
were O
not O
so O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
. O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess B-A
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
Five O
minutes O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
good O
though O
. O

bottles B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Walk O
- O
ins O
are O
risky O
too O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-A
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish B-A
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-A
tortelini I-A
. O

They O
didn O
' O
t O
give O
us O
the O
dinner B-A
special I-A
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-A
lasagna I-A
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-A
bread I-A
pudding I-A
for O
dessert B-A
. O

word O
of O
advice O
, O
save O
room O
for O
pasta B-A
dishes I-A
and O
never O
leave O
until O
you O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
tiramisu B-A
. O

Very O
good O
service B-A
and O
very O
good O
prices B-A
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
-- O
the O
staff B-A
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu B-A
, O
present O
your O
meal B-A
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

Ess O
- O
A O
- O
Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty O
- O
town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-A
in O
NY O
. O

Our O
food B-A
was O
great O
too O
! O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
night O
person O
) O

The O
most O
annoying O
thing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers B-A
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O
. O

Get O
your O
food B-A
to O
go O
, O
find O
a O
bench O
, O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate B-A
of I-A
dumplings I-A
. O

Please O
try O
the O
Filet B-A
Mignon I-A
, O
its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O
piece O
ever O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O
. O

We O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
replacestart B-A
bar I-A
replaceend O
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria B-A
, O
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
replacestart B-A
bar I-A
replaceend O
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
, O
the O
$ O
2 O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O
replacestart B-A
bar I-A
replaceendtender O
took O
it O
. O

Something O
about O
them O
being O
busy O
with O
holiday O
party O
' O
s O
. O

The O
sake B-A
menu I-A
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

This O
place O
is O
great O
. O

the O
drinks B-A
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
back O
to O
nha O
trang O
literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B-A
cubes I-A
- O
they O
' O
re O
that O
good O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
service B-A
, O
wine B-A
selection I-A
, O
ambiance B-A
are O
all O
outstanding O
and O
deserve O
recognition O
. O

Went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
2 O
year O
anniversery O
, O
and O
wasn O
' O
t O
all O
that O
impressed O
. O

It O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
seat O
us O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
as O
we O
had O
reservations B-A
, O
however O
after O
that O
the O
service B-A
was O
slow O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
NYC O
. O

It O
' O
s O
really O
also O
the O
service B-A
, O
is O
good O
and O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
friendly O
. O

Suan O
was O
a O
recommendation O
that O
I O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B-A
very O
small O
, O
including O
dessert B-A
. O

We O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
' O
s O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B-A
noise I-A
. O

Also O
, O
the O
place O
is O
popular O
with O
families O
, O
so O
if O
you O
' O
re O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O

I O
' O
ll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Lived O
in O
Shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food B-A
was O
comparable O
to O
the O
flagship O
Green O
Bo O
restaurant O
there O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
for O
their O
food B-A
, O
the O
ambience B-A
and O
wonderful O
service B-A
. O

However O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
worth O
a O
special O
trip O
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

Gigino O
' O
s O
in O
Wagner O
Park O
is O
so O
enjoyable O
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-A
meeting I-A
with O
business O
associates O
. O

All O
the O
NYU O
students O
love O
this O
place O
so O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese B-A
that O
is O
...). O

But O
, O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking B-A
. O

Joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool O
spot O
with O
decent O
food B-A
and O
a O
colorful O
- O
if O
not O
relaxed O
- O
atmosphere B-A
. O

If O
that O
' O
s O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O
McDonald O
' O
s O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O

The O
Prix B-A
Fixe I-A
menu I-A
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity B-A
AND O
quality B-A
). O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
3 O
times O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-A
benedict I-A
for O
brunch B-A
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B-A
sauce I-A
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

I O
work O
near O
- O
by O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O
BEST O
oatmeal B-A
in O
the O
neighborhood O
- O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick O
- O
cooked O
item O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
menu B-A
looked O
good O
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean B-A
Sea I-A
Bass I-A
, O
but O
the O
server B-A
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials B-A
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

Sexy O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
really O
good O
, O
I O
had O
the O
onion B-A
soup I-A
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ever O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
, O
this O
Bengali O
Fast O
Food O
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
$ O
40pp O
( O
including O
wine B-A
), O
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O
. O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B-A
welcomes O
you O
- O
don O
' O
t O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner B-A
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
for O
Dim B-A
Sum I-A
again O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
roll I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
into O
an O
inside O
- O
out O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
roll I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
, O
but O
the O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
roll I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice B-A
. O

Even O
with O
John O
' O
s O
and O
Joe O
' O
s O
around O
the O
corner O
, O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
did O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
make O
a O
gin B-A
and I-A
replacestart I-A
tonic I-A
replaceend O
-- O
couldn O
' O
t O
find O
tonic B-A
. O

My O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
. O

The O
dim B-A
sum I-A
is O
ok O
but O
doesn O
' O
t O
taste O
that O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
little B-A
dishes I-A
don O
' O
t O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
( O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
Chinese O
here O
). O

despite O
the O
untasteful O
previous O
review O
... O

Don O
' O
t O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Sure O
, O
everyone O
' O
s O
got O
their O
favorite O
, O
but O
to O
know O
Sal O
, O
is O
to O
know O
New O
York O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

The O
service B-A
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-A
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation B-A
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-A
Chicken I-A
special I-A
with I-A
Edamame I-A
Puree I-A
. O

This O
is O
as O
good O
as O
neighborhood O
restaurants O
come O
. O

If O

If O

and O
see O
if O
you O
dont O
agree O
with O
me O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot O
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O

Very O
popular O

Izakaya O

small O

Hurley O

like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

Not O
pretentious O
and O
very O
economical O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
terrific O
and O
the O
service B-A
classy O
, O
attentive O
, O
without O
being O
overbearing O
. O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B-A
rolls I-A
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-A
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
charging O
the O
meal B-A
or O
the O
tip B-A
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
but O
we O
live O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
walk O
from O
them O
. O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

Authentic O
bistro O
! O

They O
are O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B-A
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
American O
digestive O
system O
. O

Somewhat O
pricey O
but O
what O
the O
heck O
. O

It O
' O
s O
true O
, O
this O
place O
is O
not O
cheap O
. O

Try O
the O
hot B-A
dogs I-A
too O
, O
they O
' O
re O
snappy O
and O
delicious O
. O

Delivery B-A
is O
fast O
too O

found O
out O
about O

The O
noise B-A
level I-A
was O
unbearable O
, O
conversation O
impossible O

Personal B-A
pans I-A
are O
the O
perfect O

Highly O

One O
of O
the O

not O

that O

going O
on O
with O
the O

a O

It O
' O

Thanks O
Bloom O
' O

for O
a O
lovely O
trip O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
great O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
laid O
back O
scene O
and O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O

Oh O
right O
, O
I O
should O
probably O
say O
something O
nice O
. O

Odd O
for O
Ave O
B O
, O
not O
just O
odd O
, O
The O
place B-A
attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O

we O
thought O
that O
we O

the O

the O

I O
had O
the O
salmon B-A
dish I-A
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine O
, O
for O
the O
price B-A
paid O
, O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor B-A
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
tuna B-A
melt I-A
- O
it O
came O
with O
out O
cheese B-A
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna B-A
sandwich I-A
. O

Especially O
liked O
chicken B-A
tikka I-A
and O
the O
naan B-A
, O
and O
the O
dals B-A
. O

The O
waiters B-A
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill B-A
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
. O

The O
restaurant O
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns B-A
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff B-A
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

We O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O
Kai O
was O
way O
to O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
. O

The O
sangria B-A
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
eat O
here O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
starving O
for O
thai B-A
food I-A
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg O
spot O
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-A
plus O
great O
service B-A
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-A
ever O
. O

While O
the O
menu B-A
isn O
' O
t O
especially O
groundbreaking O
, O
everything O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
so O
far O
has O
been O
well O
- O
executed O
and O
tasty O
. O

Ive O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
always O
outstanding O
. O

The O
bill B-A
is O
approximately O
$ O
25 O
for O
2 O
at O
lunch B-A
without O
drinks B-A
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
, O
service B-A
is O
ok O
. O

The O
overall O
price B-A
tag I-A
was O
very O
very O
expensive O
, O
something O
I O
did O
expect O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
were O
done O
, O
it O
was O
past O
1 O
: O
00am O
. O

Spice O
is O
great O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
love O
the O
inexpensive O
appetizers B-A
. O

Read O
all O
the O
other O
review O
, O
they O
' O
ll O
confirm O
it O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
. O

He O
not O
only O
makes O
his O
own O
homemade O
mozzarella B-A
, O
but O
every O
pie B-A
is O
ultra O
fresh O
. O

Fish B-A
was O
overdone O
. O

Great O
idea O
and O
base O
for O
restaurant O
, O
but O
work O
on O
the O
details O
, O
people O
who O
think O
this O
was O
good O
need O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
shore O
towns O
and O
rethink O
what O
it O
should O
have O
tasted O
like O
. O

When O
you O
' O
re O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-A
dining I-A
room I-A
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-A
) O
you O
' O
d O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

We O
visited O
Bread O
Bar O
during O
January O
restaurant O
week O
and O
were O
so O
pleased O
with O
the O
menu B-A
selections I-A
and O
service B-A
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B-A
being O
piped O
in O
- O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O
. O

You O
could O
get O
a O
much O
better O
dining O
experience O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
French O
Bistros O
. O

The O
establishment B-A
scores O
big O
points O
in O
presentation O
and O
style O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-A
sum I-A
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Good O
food B-A
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
overly O
efficient O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
dim B-A
sum I-A
however O
was O
very O
good O
. O

It O
' O
s O
better O
than O
being O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
Sutton O
Place O
with O
19 O
year O
old O
interns O
jabbing O
you O
in O
the O
ribs O
all O
night O
. O

Service B-A
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
. O

Went O
there O
and O
had O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
seafood B-A
dishes I-A
and O
appetizers B-A
. O

Its O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
casual O
date O
or O
to O
entertain O
clients O
for O
lunch B-A
. O

All O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
if O
he O
crushed O
the O
grapes B-A
himself O
when O
their O
long O
overdue O
bottle B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
finally O
arrived O
. O

Prices B-A
are O
very O
good O
. O

We O
could O
not O
catch O
our O
waiter B-A
' O
s O
eye O
, O
and O
he O
ignored O
us O
. O

Fantastic O
place O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
it O
' O
s O
bad O
thai B-A
food I-A
. O

Definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant O
to O
skip O
! O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

Usually O
3 O
vs O
. O
4 O
items O
per O
dish B-A
. O

While O
certain O
staples B-A
are O
excellent O
( O
the O
burger B-A
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas B-A
), O
the O
food B-A
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

The O
Dim B-A
Sum I-A
was O
so O
- O
so O
, O
but O
not O
spectacular O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
so O
- O
so O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O

affordable O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-A
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

The O
lobster B-A
sandwich I-A
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price B-A
. O

May O
, O
the O
owner B-A
always O
has O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
will O
warmly O
greet O
you O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel O
' O
s O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

The O
sides B-A
were O
ok O
and O
incredibly O
salty O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
all O
the O
seafood B-A
on O
the O
menu B-A
was O
unavailable O
except O
for O
the O
Salmon B-A
. O

Not O
a O
large O
place B-A
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
cute O
and O
cozy O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

and O
there O
' O
s O
no O
way O
out O
. O

The O
beverages B-A
were O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-A
was O
good O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
and O
the O
waitress B-A
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian B-A
appetizers I-A
and O
drinks B-A
. O

Please O
if O
your O
thinking O
about O
it O
go O
, O
and O
stay O
the O
wait B-A
you O
won O
' O
t O
be O
disappointed O
. O

I O
must O
say O
the O
view B-A
of O
NYC O
is O
so O
beautiful O
! O

If O
you O
' O
d O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
light O
meal B-A
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
, O
Long O
Tan O
is O
a O
good O
place O
on O

When O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B-A

I O
like O
a O
nice O
ambiance B-A

well O

good O

don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
place O
has O
great O
service B-A
and O
prices B-A
and O
a O
nice O
friendly O
atmosphere B-A
. O

Highly O
recommend O
this O
as O
great O
value B-A
for O
excellent O
sushi B-A
and O
service B-A
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served B-A
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service B-A
. O

A O
++ O
The O
service B-A
was O
good O
to O
excellent O
along O
with O
the O
attitude B-A
. O

This O
is O
my O
fourth O
try O
over O
a O
two O
year O
period O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
done O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
awesome O
- O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B-A
bass I-A
. O

The O
music B-A
does O
get O
a O
little O
loud O
at O
times O
, O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
, O
and O
as O
I O
did O
, O
I O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander B-A
. O

black B-A
white I-A
shakes I-A
came O
out O
good O
also O
. O

It O
' O
s O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-A
in O
NYC O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
seating B-A
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
chu B-A
chu I-A
curry I-A
and O
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad B-A
thai I-A
chicken I-A
. O

We O
go O
on O
Mondays O
for O
the O
prix B-A
fixe I-A
and O
our O
experience O
with O
the O
food B-A
has O
been O
comparable O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
my O
second O
favorite O
neighborhood O
Thai O
place O
( O
the O
first O
being O
Joya O
). O

However O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
got O
the O
most O
amazing O
pastrami B-A
and O
the O
soups B-A
hit O
the O
spot O
. O

Great O
bagels B-A
made O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
way O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-A
. O

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B-A
with I-A
lox I-A
spread I-A
, O
but O
all O
the O
bagles B-A
are O
unbeliavably O
good O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food B-A
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-A
was O
crappy O
, O
too O
. O

For O
the O
next O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
we O
stood O
in O
the O
crowded O
lobby B-A
area I-A
of O
this O
touristy O
restaurant O
listening O
to O
all O
types O
of O
explanations O
of O
why O
we O
were O
not O
being O
seated B-A
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Also O
good O
for O
client O
lunch B-A
meetings I-A
, O
esp O
. O

For O
$ O
600 O
( O
the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
) O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
dark O
, O
cool O
and O
soothing O
, O
while O
the O
food B-A
' I-A
s I-A
presentation I-A
is O
spectacular O
, O
considering O
the O
low O
prices B-A
. O

The O
Waitstaff B-A
were O
very O
nice O
and O
suggested O
swordfish B-A
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed O
his O
meal B-A
. O

The O
setting B-A
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-A
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
- O
down O
. O

Great O
friendly O
service B-A
, O
Fast O
seating B-A
, O
Fast O
Delivery B-A
, O
Excellent O
sushi B-A
. O

The O
desserts B-A
are O
more O
appealing O
then O
stuffy O
overpriced O
French O
restaurants O
. O

The O
Italian B-A
food I-A
has O
flavor O
( O
that O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
surprising O
on O
the O
UES O
), O
and O
the O
service B-A
turns O
from O
a O
nightmare O
to O
attentive O
, O
they O
sort O
of O
remind O
me O
of O
the O
NY O
Yankees O
of O
the O
late O
90 O
' O
s O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
look O
, O
you O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
rally O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
... O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-A
dish I-A
I O
had O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-A
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

The O
New O
York O
Times O
has O
reviewed O
this O
place O
three O
times O
already O
, O
you O
know O
it O
' O
s O
going O
to O
be O
good O
. O

Baluchi O
' O
s O
has O
solid O
food B-A
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices B-A
. O

Emilio O
, O
the O
owner B-A
, O
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
spice O
three O
times O
- O
twice O
during O
lunch B-A
and O
once O
at O
dinner B-A
. O

Moules B-A
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-A
ravioli I-A
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

I O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
expecting O
to O
be O
surprised O
but O
left O
bored O
and O
overcharged O
. O

A O
cheap O
eat B-A
for O
NYC O
, O
but O
not O
for O
dosa B-A
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

The O
seafood B-A
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
good O
wine B-A
list I-A
, O
and O
the O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-A
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

i O
don O
' O
t O
usually O
order O
wine B-A
with O
indian B-A
so O
i O
can O
' O
t O
comment O
on O
their O
wine B-A
list O
or O
their O
wine B-A
replaceends I-A
. I-A

Pastrami B-A
or I-A
corned I-A
beef I-A
are O
juicy O
and O
piled O
high O
( O
ask O
for O
extra O
rye B-A
bread I-A
). O

($ O
200 O
for O
2 O
glasses B-A
of I-A
champagne I-A
, O
not O
too O
expensive O
bottle B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
and O
2 O
after B-A
dinner I-A
drinks I-A
). O

Really O
though O
, O
where O
' O
s O
the O
seasoning B-A
? O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
just O
OK O
, O
at O
least O
for O
what O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
available O
. O

by O
dinner O
time O
, O
they O
turn O
it O
around O
and O
mount O
a O
huge O
comeback O
!! O

The O
waitress B-A
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
ambience B-A
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
so O
great O
. O

Solid O
wine B-A
list I-A
, O
knowledgeable O
staff B-A
, O
friendly O
owners B-A
and O
an O
adventurous O
, O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-A
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
people B-A
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
see O
a O
menu B-A
, O
as O
our O
waiter B-A
described O
both O
the O
specials B-A
and O
the O
main B-A
dishes I-A
. O

The O
location B-A
and O
ambience B-A
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

otherwise O
, O
good O
stuff B-A
for O
late O
nite O
eats B-A
. O

The O
dinner B-A
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O
. O

I O
love O
and O
I O
know O
gourmet B-A
food I-A
by O
excellence O
! O

I O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment O
of O
bruschetta B-A
, O
panini B-A
' O
s O
..... O

Great O
people O
watching O
as O
others O
do O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
just O
an O
unintentional O
mistake O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
experienced O
the O
same O
with O
other O
restaurants O
so O
I O
don O
' O
t O
appreciate O
such O
practice O
. O

Two O
people O
in O
our O
party O
felt O
like O
something O
else O
, O
and O
Volare O
immediately O
obliged O
with O
two O
great O
dishes B-A
that O
were O
not O
in O
their O
regular O
menu B-A
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-A
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
remembers O
me O
and O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O
is O
and O
that O
' O
s O
the O
fried B-A
mini I-A
buns I-A
with I-A
the I-A
condensed I-A
milk I-A
and I-A
the I-A
assorted I-A
fruits I-A
on I-A
beancurd I-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
. O

Diner O
food B-A
at O
bistro O
prices B-A
is O
a O
bummer O
.... O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
been O
going O
here O
regularly O
for O
two O
years O
. O

wow O
! O
how O
have O
i O
missed O
this O
one O
, O
tried O
Long O
Tan O
last O
week O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
now O
know O
what O
the O
NY O
TIMES O
and O
many O
more O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
already O
knew O
. O

Go O
there O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
leave O
feeling O
like O
a O
baby O
Veal O
Calf O
( O
ok O
bad O
joke O
), O
but O
you O
will O
see O
. O

While O
we O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-A
, O
it O
was O
annoying O
to O
scream O
across O
the O
table O
for O
conversation O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-A
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-A
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter B-A
. O

delicious O
bagels B-A
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

Ive O
passed O
by O
the O
spot O
tons O
of O
times O
always O
wanting O
to O
go O
in O
. O

All O
the O
food B-A
was O
hot O
tasty O
. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

This O
is O
one O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
pizza B-A
more O
out O
but O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
take O
- O
out O
pizza B-A
. O

Our O
server B-A
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

Try O
green B-A
curry I-A
with I-A
vegetables I-A
. O

Would O
recommend O
this O
place O
as O
a O
good O
date O
spot O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
drop O
a O
ton O
of O
cash O
. O

While O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
happens O
all O
the O
time O
- O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
treatment O
that O
buys O
repeat O
business O
! O

This O
place O
was O
not O
ALL O
THAT O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-A
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
' O
s O
editorial O
review O
. O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B-A
, O
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced B-A
too O
! O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
not O
very O
tasty O
, O
the O
portioins B-A
were O
tiny O
even O
for O
such O
a O
high O
quality O
restaurant O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Others O
have O
to O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
feel O
sad O
until O
they O
' O
re O
eaten O
. O

Why O
make O
a O
reservation B-A
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
going O
to O
keep O
it O
? O

The O
Pad B-A
Thai I-A
is O
excellent O
here O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Big O
and O
gawky O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Mary O
' O
s O
many O
times O
and O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Searching O
to O
get O
out O
from O
the O
cold O
, O
freezing O
weather O
, O
we O
went O
into O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
a O
deli O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
lunch B-A
specials I-A
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
!!!!! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
in O
Soho O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
had O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
parked O
on O
the O
block O
of O
Nina O
' O
s O
the O
place B-A
looked O
nice O
, O
with O
people O
obviously O
enjoying O
their O
pizzas B-A
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

For O
$ O
760 O
for O
2 O
people O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
o O
. O
k O
., O
but O
not O
any O
better O
than O
what O
you O
get O
at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O
. O

We O
had O
the O
pot B-A
- I-A
stickers I-A
which O
were O
great O
and O
a O
tempura B-A
dish I-A
that O
was O
great O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff B-A
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
good O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O
. O

While O
the O
$ O
20 O
entree B-A
range I-A
is O
not O
overly O
expensive O
, O
in O
New O
York O
City O
, O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
food B-A
in O
that O
range O
, O
and O
so O
Sapphire O
, O
despite O
it O
' O
s O
lovely O
atmosphere B-A
, O
will O
most O
likely O
not O
be O
a O
restaurant O
to O
which O
I O
will O
return O
. O

Orsay O
, O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
authentic O
French B-A
food I-A
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New O
York O
where O
I O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted O
and O
ignored O
and O
I O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

It O
' O
s O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

Well O
, O
their O
deliveries B-A
take O
for O
ever O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
usually O
cold O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O

ordered O
the O
smoked B-A

and I-A
roe I-A
appetizer I-A
and O
it O
was O
off O

. O

We O
went O

a O
couple O
of O
weeks O

on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O

shrimp I-A
, O
okra B-A
( I-A

and O
anything O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place O
. O

To O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
good O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
to O
Ping O
' O
s O
three O
weekends O
in O
a O
row O
!!! O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter B-A
, O
we O
' O
re O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

The O
menu B-A
was O
impressive O
with O
selections O
ranging O
from O
a O
burger B-A
, O
to O
steak B-A
, O
to O
escargot B-A
. O

In O
fact O
, O
two O
people O
could O
really O
share O
one O
plate B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
authentic O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
' O
ll O
definitely O
be O

during O
happy O
hour O

Good O
for O
casual B-A
dinner I-A
with O

Anyway O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
the O
price B-A
is O
right O
and O
they O
have O
a O
decent O
wine B-A
list I-A
. O

Go O
, O
go O
, O
hurry O
, O
before O
everyone O
finds O
out O
about O
it O
. O

Prices B-A
are O
higher O
to O
dine O
in O
and O
their O
chicken B-A
tikka I-A
marsala I-A
is O
quite O
good O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

This O
place O
has O
many O
different O
styles B-A
of I-A
pizza I-A
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing O
. O

The O
photos O
of O
the O
restaurant O
in O
its O
web O
site O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
real O
look B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-A
tiny O
. O

But O
the O
coconut B-A
rice I-A
was O
good O
. O

It O
took O
them O
25 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
our O
appetizer B-A
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
this O
neighborhood O
spot O
for O
years O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
great O
. O

Pair O
you O
food B-A
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B-A
on I-A
tap I-A
or O
their O
well O
priced B-A
wine B-A
list I-A
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-A
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-A
minimun I-A
then O
you O
' O
ll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

All O
of O
my O
co O
- O
workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
amazing O
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
hadn O
' O
t O
heard O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Anyway O
, O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
cross O
the O
williamsburg O
. O

Metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful O
spot B-A
overlooking O
the O

that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal B-A
and O
the O
company O

' O
re O
with O

When O
I O
' O

feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O

Guess O
the O

ads O
didn O
' O
t O
launch O

The O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
small O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
get O
a O
table B-A
quickly O
. O

Besides O
, O
we O
were O
on O
vacation O

I O
love O
this O

Rest O

Quality B-A
of I-A

This O
is O
my O
favorite O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
. O

The O
place B-A

a O
little O

The O

as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-A
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
). O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
fresh O
, O
delicious O
, O
and O
reasonably O

Raga O
stands O
out O
with O
an O
interesting O
fusion B-A
of I-A
French I-A

A O
few O
tips O

skip O
the O
turnip B-A
cake I-A
, O
roast B-A
pork I-A
buns I-A
and O
egg B-A

The O

Oh O
yes O

and O
they O
lie O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
claiming O
they O
have O
seating B-A
in I-A
the I-A

then O
of O

the O

for O
lunch B-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B-A
( O
too O
close O
to O
downtown O
). O

Their O
calzones B-A
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

It O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-A
and O
they O
almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
( O
although O
they O
dont O
forget O
to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O
. O

The O
place B-A
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-A
scene I-A
seems O
to O
be O
happening O

Saturday O
, O
Nov O

6th O
I O
had O
a O
group O
from O
work O

amazing O
to O
accomodate O
us O
. O

Good O
spreads B-A
, O
great O
beverage B-A
selections I-A
and O
bagels B-A
really O
tasty O

First O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
who O
served B-A
us O
neglected O
to O
fill O
us O
in O
on O
the O
specials B-A
, O
which O
I O
would O
have O
chosen O
had O
I O
known O
about O
them O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

Also O
, O
top O
the O
meal B-A
with O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfect O
slice O
of O
tiramisu B-A

It O
seems O
like O
this O
is O
a O
place O
the O
locals O
like O
and O
the O
people O
working O

liked O

too O

Authentic O
food B-A

just O
the O
rush O

sometimes O
when O
they O
try O
to O

you O
out O

. O

Stick O

I O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
poor O
reviews O
- O
I O
find O
this O
place O
to O
be O
standout O
Italian O
in O
an O
area O
flooded O
with O
Italian O
- O
great O
prices B-A
, O
great O
atmosphere B-A
, O
good O
service B-A
and O
a O
wonderful O
wine B-A
list I-A
. O

I O
was O
back O
- O
to O
- O
back O
with O
the O
diner B-A
at O
the O
table B-A
behind O
me O
and O
wait B-A
staff I-A
had O
to O
hoist O
trays O
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-A
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-A
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
leary O
about O
Mary O
' O
s O
at O
first O
- O
it O
' O
s O
small O
, O
crowded O
and O
you O
usually O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
- O
but O
I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
finally O
tried O
it O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
only O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
once O
, O
but O
we O
have O
ordered O
many O
times O
for O
dinner B-A
. O

I O
got O
enough O
reasons O
to O
keep O
coming O
back O
!!! O

By O
far O
this O
is O
the O
only O
chinese O
desserts O
place O
I O
know O
in O
NY O
or O
anywhere O
close O
in O
the O
Northeastern O
America O
that O
serves O
desserts B-A
with I-A
frog I-A
jelly I-A
in O
a O
couple O
of O
varieties O
and O
pig B-A
feet I-A
ginger I-A
simmered I-A
in I-A
black I-A
vinegar I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced B-A
. O

The O
characters O
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-A
cuisine I-A
! O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host B-A
, O
Vittorio O
, O
and O
his O
crew B-A
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
-- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
' O
s O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
- O
so O
- O
frequent O
visitor O
. O

The O
restuarant O
itself O
is O
not O
large O
, O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
several O
round B-A
tables I-A
to O
accomodate O
large O
groups O
hoping O
to O
save O
a O
buck O
to O
eat O
authentic O
Taiwanese B-A
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
' O
ve O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-A
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-A
fries I-A
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O
. O

It O
is O
the O
type O
of O
place O
to O
run O
into O
old O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
late O
, O
raucus O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
- O
from O
the O
specials B-A
to O
the O
regular B-A
menu I-A
- I-A
fare I-A
, O
the O
dishes B-A
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Prices B-A
are O
in O
line O

The O
combination O
of O
fresh B-A
tomato I-A
sauce I-A
, O
fresh B-A
mozz I-A
cheese I-A
, O
basil B-A
and O
the O
dough B-A
they O
make O
with O
imported O
flour B-A
, O
makes O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
pizza B-A
' O
s O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

and O
for O
this O
i O
had O
to O
shell O
out O
a O
small O
fortune O
? O

For O
all O
of O
you O
new O
to O
Indian B-A
food I-A
, O
try O
the O
Paneer B-A
Roll I-A
, O
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
heaven O
. O

The O
food B-A
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates B-A
. O

Both O
the O
fresh B-A
mozzerella I-A
slices I-A
and O
the O
Plain B-A
Cheese I-A
slice I-A
are O
phenomenal O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
literally O
every O
restaurant O
on O
curry O
row O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
this O
monster O
sushi O
twice O
, O
the O
46th O
st O
once O
, O
the O
23rd O
st O
one O
a O
number O
of O
times O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
NOT O
something O
to O
get O
worked O
up O
about O
. O

It O
' O
s O
constantly O
open O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
Pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
Crosby O
St O
., O
so O
there O
' O
s O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B-A
than O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
( O
i O
. O
e O
., O
surprisingly O
fresh O
). O

I O
had O
Filet B-A

with I-A

I O
went O
at O

and O
it O
was O
marvelous O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-A
were O
attentive O
, O
polite O
and O
helpful O
- O
an O
impressive O
feat O
in O
such O
close O
quarters O

Go O

the O

makes O
you O
want O
more O

the O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O

however O
be O
warned O

a O
margarite O

cold O

on O

, O
like O
a O
salad B-A

Yes O
, O
the O
prices B-A
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

of O
bruschettas B-A
, O
paninis B-A
, O
tramezzinis B-A
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

Have O
always O
found O
that O
the O
waiters B-A
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
helpful O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
often O
busy O
with O
lots O
of O
diners B-A
. O

While O
this O
isn O
' O
t O
classical O
restaurant O
fare O
, O
the O
chef B-A
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
an O
old O
cuisine B-A
with O
some O
really O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
dishes B-A
that O
are O
genuinely O
Indian B-A
without O
being O
heavy O
or O
same O
old O
restaurant O
burn O
- O
outs O
. O

The O
owner B-A
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

He O
takes O
real O
pride O
in O
his O
food B-A
and O
his O
business O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant O
Saul O
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
nice O
, O
enjoyable O
meal B-A
at O
Montparnasse O
, O
go O
early O
for O
the O
pre B-A
- I-A
theater I-A
prix I-A
- I-A
fixe I-A
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
it O
has O
always O
provided O
a O
pleasurable O
dining B-A
experience O
with O
quality O
food B-A
and O
wine B-A
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
tho O
. O

The O
photobook O
menu B-A
was O
a O
cute O
touch O
, O
certainly O
helped O
my O
group O
and O
I O
pick O
the O
fried B-A
chicken I-A
, O
pork B-A
chop I-A
, O
and O
noodle B-A
dishes I-A
that O
we O
all O
ordered O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-A
food I-A
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Great O

A O
pleasant O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open B-A

cheese I-A
sandwich I-A
and O
the O
manager B-A
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O

! O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
all O
that O
noise O
then O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
. O

We O

with O
us O
. O

Get O
there O
before O
7pm O

very O
good O

if O
this O
happens O
, O
just O
ask O

some O
inedible O

So O

if O
yo O
really O
don O
' O
t O
care O
who O
is O
sittingnext O
to O
you O
, O
which O
is O
about O
2 O
inches O
away O
, O
I O
would O
say O
try O
it O
. O

Pizza B-A
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-A
pasta I-A
. O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value B-A
ofr I-A
money I-A
. O

My O
first O
encounter O
happened O
one O
friday O
evening O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Example O
is O
the O
soup B-A
which O
was O
about O
6 O
oz O
for O
$ O
12 O
dollars O
and O
the O
mushrooms B-A
where O
$ O
12 O
for O
about O
1oz O
. O

Service B-A
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting B-A
! O

From O
beginning B-A
appetizers I-A
, O
the O
scallops B-A
were O
incredible O
, O
to O
the O
delicious O
chocolate B-A
souffle I-A
with I-A
rasberry I-A
mint I-A
sorbet I-A
, O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O
taste B-A
sensations O
. O

OU O
MUST O
TRY O
THIS O
RESTAURANT O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O

return O
. O

Consistently O
good O
Japanese B-A
Tapas I-A
. O

No O
apologies O
during O
restaurant O
week O
. O

My O
goodness O
, O
everything O
from O
the O
fish B-A
to O
the O
rice B-A
to O
the O
seaweed B-A
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

This O
place O
started O
off O
a O
little O
iffy O
, O
but O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
( O
and O
I O
' O
m O
indian O
, O
so O
I O
should O
know O
). O

They O
also O
do O
a O
great O
job O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

The O
dishes B-A
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-A
sausages I-A
, O
sardines B-A
with I-A
biscuits I-A
, O
large B-A
whole I-A
shrimp I-A
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-A
ice I-A
cream I-A
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
). O

This O
is O
where O
the O
aforementioned O
line O
was O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price B-A
is O
moderate O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
bearded O
, O
courdoroy O
blazer O
professor O
type O
with O
the O
NYU O
student O
he O
' O
s O
sleeping O
with O
that O
week O
, O
you O
see O
a O
strange O
mix O
of O
hipsters O
, O
frat O
boys O
, O
Will O
Smith O
types O
who O
need O
to O
be O
told O
they O
are O
black O
, O
bitter O
cougars O
who O
cant O
understand O
why O
they O
arent O
married O
yet O
.... O

While O
the O
ambiance B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

We O
always O
go O
there O
on O
the O
weekends O
and O
leave O
extremely O
full O
and O
satisfied O
. O

i O
dont O
how O
this O
place O
is O
still O
running O
. O

The O
server B-A
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served B-A
us O
our O
food B-A
and O
drinks B-A
with O
a O
smile O
. O

We O
were O
in O
search O
of O
food B-A
and O
stumbled O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
East O
Sixth O
Street O
. O

Planet O
Thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-A
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-A
food I-A
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

Very O
excited O
to O
hear O
that O
short O
- O
term O
Chef B-A
Jason O
Narone O
has O
moved O
on O
, O
he O
truly O
was O
a O
low O
point O
of O
their O
Sterling O
track O
record O
. O

Excellent O
experience O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
trip O
, O
close O
to O
City O
Hall O
and O
downtown O
subway O
stops O
. O

I O
had O
to O
share O
my O
table B-A
with O
a O
loud O
group O
of O
kids O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
rude O
an O
unattentive O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
see O
how O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O
. O

The O
sauce B-A
on I-A
the I-A
pizza I-A
is O
sooo O
good O
with O
garlic B-A
and O
fresh B-A
tomatoes I-A
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
skimp O
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-A
seating I-A
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

My O
husband O
had O
the O
mesclun B-A
, O
salmon B-A
, O
and O
ice B-A
cream I-A
and O
he O
enjoyed O
all O
3 O
courses B-A
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
the O
wait B-A
was O
about O
twenty O
minutes O
and O
there O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
for O

I O

( O
the O
chilaquiles B-A

awesome O
! O

The O
prices B-A
were O
fantastic O

What O
a O
great O
place O
! O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O

were O
off O

set O
by O
the O
pour O

your O
- O
own O
measures B-A
of I-A

which O
were O

have O

a O
little O
more O
attentive O
but O
as O
someone O
who O
also O
works O
in O
the O
service B-A
industry O
, O
I O
understood O
they O
were O
busy O
. O

It O
' O

not O
mind O

blowing O
, O
but O
to O
me O
, O
thai B-A
food I-A
never O
is O
and O
never O
will O
be O
. O

Food B-A
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-A
belly I-A
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat B-A
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
). O

Although O
, O
one O
night O
we O
went O
it O
was O
super O
cheesy O
, O
and O
another O
night O
it O
was O
less O
cheesy O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
yell O
at O
each O
other O
to O
talk O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
been O

and O
both O

I O

that O
the O

so O
good O
and O
is O
so O
cheap O

Nicky O
the O

I O
went O

. O

I O
haven O
' O

a O
lamb B-A

as O
delicious O
as O
that O
, O
the O
salads B-A
are O
really O
nice O
dressed O
with O
lemon B-A
and O
extra B-A
virgnin I-A
olive I-A

. O

The O
sushi B-A
was O
awful O
! O

Katz O
' O
s O
has O
been O
a O
NYC O
original O
for O
over O
100 O
years O
. O

You O
can O
get O
an O
excellent O
meal B-A
at O
most O
of O
the O
many O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
nearby O
Lexington O
Avenue O
for O
the O
cost B-A
of O
one O
the O
dainty O
dishes B-A
here O
. O

The O
Pastrami B-A
sandwich I-A
was O
like O
buttah O
and O
with O
pickles B-A
and O
an O
icy O
cold O
beer B-A
to O
wash O
it O
down O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pleasurable O
experience O
. O

The O
plain B-A
pizza I-A
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
creative O
wild B-A
mushroom I-A
( I-A
third I-A
generation I-A
- I-A
Fornini I-A
) I-A
pizza I-A
we O
had O
was O
drenched O
with O
truffle B-A
oil I-A
in O
the O
middle O
( O
again O
making O
it O
soggy O
) O
and O
nothingon O
the O
rest O
. O

Late O
nite O
omelletes B-A
are O
not O
good O
here O
, O
there O
is O
no O
variety O
! O

Everything O
at O
Sala O
Thai O
is O
tasty O
and O
well O
- O
portioned O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
cheap O
lunch B-A
or O
dinner B-A
. O

Behind O
this O
counter B-A
, O
two O
men O
are O
squeezed O
in O
. O

Great O
find O
!!! O

If O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they O
' O
d O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi B-A
fix I-A
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-A
and O
great O
service B-A
. O

Our O
waitress B-A
was O
sweet O
and O
accomodating O
, O
not O
overbearing O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-A
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation B-A
sigh I-A
on O
them O
. O

I O
was O
really O
disappointed O
ant O
wanted O
to O
tell O
everyone O
not O
to O
go O
eat O
or O
even O
take O
out O
food B-A
from O
there O
. O

The O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place B-A
look O
wonderful O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-A
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food B-A
art I-A
. O

The O
outdoor B-A
atmosphere I-A
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-A
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
' O
ll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I O
' O
m O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

I O
definitely O
wouldn O
' O
t O
go O
back O
. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
for O
that O
bucks O
. O

brick O
oven O
gallery O
is O
My O
pick O
for O
best O
pizza B-A
restaurant O
anywhere O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-A
and O
great O
food B-A
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-A
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

For O
many O
people O
, O
this O
may O
not O
seem O
like O
Aunthentic O
Thai B-A
food I-A
because O
most O
places O
in O
NYC O
arent O
quite O
authentic O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels B-A
. O

Oh O
, O
don O
' O
t O
even O
let O
me O
start O
with O
how O
expensive O
the O
bills B-A
were O
! O

A O
hearty O
two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

The O
scallion B-A
pancakes I-A
and O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

All O
the O
appetizers B-A
and O
salads B-A
were O
fabulous O
, O
the O
steak B-A
was O
mouth O
watering O
and O
the O
pasta B-A
was O
delicious O
!!! O

Besides O
having O
the O
replacestart B-A
table I-A
replaceend O
we O
had O
been O
promised O
given O
to O
other O
restaurant O
patrons O
twice O
before O
we O
were O
actually O
seated O
, O
we O
were O
replacestart B-A
served I-A
replaceend O
dishes B-A
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
ordered O
three O
times O
, O
received O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
20 O
minutes O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A
table I-A
replaceend O
had O
been O
replacestart B-A
served I-A
replaceend O
( O
and O
that O
order O
was O
undercooked O
), O
and O
charged O
$ O
45 O
more O
than O
we O
should O
have O
been O
on O
our O
bill B-A
. O

Service B-A
is O
top O
notch O
. O

The O
food B-A
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

All O
pretty O
good O
. O

You O
can O
also O
special O
order O
any O
kind O
of O
dumpling B-A
, O
etc O
. O

you O
guys O
rock O
. O

Chance O
is O
a O
joke O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
much O
full O
after O
our O
fondue B-A
appetizer I-A
. O

BE O
CAREFUL O
before O
you O
request O
extra O
spice B-A
. O

The O
octopus O
eaters O
were O
floored O
by O
the O
Octopus B-A
salad I-A
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG B-A
cooking I-A
in O
the O
foods B-A
. O

I O
was O
at O
Rao O
' O
s O
last O
Wed O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-A
Kha I-A
soup I-A
was O
pathetic O
. O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-A
beer I-A
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-A
- I-A
private I-A
boths I-A
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining B-A
hall I-A
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

Service B-A
was O
quick O
. O

Tends O
to O
turn O
people O
away O
. O

We O
thought O
this O
a O
prelude O
to O
what O
the O
evening O
will O
be O
like O
. O

I O
was O
turned O
on O
to O
this O
restaurant O
by O
a O
fellow O
foodie O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
and O
have O
been O
going O
back O
regularly O
ever O
since O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-A
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
toast O
! O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office B-A
lunch I-A
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland O
Brewery O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero O
Pomodori O
. O

The O
sweet B-A
lassi I-A
was O
excellent O
as O
was O
the O
lamb B-A
chettinad I-A
and O
the O
garlic B-A
naan I-A
but O
the O
rasamalai B-A
was O
forgettable O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
been O
following O
chef B-A
Lyle O
' O
s O
food B-A
around O
New O
York O
for O
15 O
years O
and O
while O
remaining O
classic O
, O
his O
innovations O
with O
bistro B-A
fare I-A
have O
made O
us O
return O
and O
return O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
I O
tasted O
were O
the O
lambchops B-A
. O

it O
' O
s O
delicious O
! O

The O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A
and O
salmon B-A
are O
the O
best O
we O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-A
, O
the O
prices B-A
are O
too O
high O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
reasonable O
. O

Upon O
entering O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
owners B-A
, O
Steven O
and O
Frederick O
, O
who O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
more O
than O
gracious O
hosts B-A
. O

If O
you O
live O
outside O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
don O
' O
t O
bother O
! O

Been O
going O
here O
since O
it O
opened O
have O
seen O
the O
quality B-A
value I-A
decrease O
considerably O
. O

Meat B-A
dishes I-A
now O
adorn O
the O
selections O
, O
although O
there O
' O
s O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
vegetarian B-A
- I-A
friendly I-A
choices I-A
. O

I O
never O
had O
anything O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
here O
. O

Reasonable O
prices B-A
. O

they O
bring O
service B-A
up O
a O
notch O
by O
offerng O
complementary O
amuse B-A
bouche I-A
to O
all O
tables B-A
and O
gave O
us O
a O
small O
dessert B-A
for O
our O
celebration O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-A
tuna I-A
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

It O
won O
' O
t O
break O
the O
bank O
but O
I O
also O
wouldnt O
come O
back O
for O
the O
food B-A
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi B-A
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Joya O
twice O
and O
I O
will O
never O
go O
again O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live B-A
entertainment I-A
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special B-A

The O

a O
great O

and O
they O
were O
happy O
to O

it O
for O
me O
without O

. O

Great O
for O
large O
groups O
and O
celebrations O
- O
our O
SUPER O
HAPPY O

of O
the O

Ciao O
Bella O

like O
saying O
her O
bread B-A
comes O
from O
a O
special O
bakery O
when O
we O
have O
seen O
her O
buying O
it O
dowtown O
manhathan O
. O

The O
dim B-A
sum I-A
servings I-A
here O
are O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
I O
' O
m O
used O
to O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2003 O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
management B-A
has O
changed O
and O
the O
great O
big O
door B-A
has O
been O
replaced O
for O
a O
glass B-A
front I-A
ridding O
itself O
of O
the O
dark O
romantic O
getup O
. O

We O
won O
' O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
much O
more O
grown O
up O
restaurant O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
street O
. O

Barbecued B-A
codfish I-A
was O
gorgeously O
moist O
- O
as O
if O
poached O
- O
yet O
the O
fabulous O
texture B-A
was O
let O
down O
by O
curiously O
bland O
seasoning B-A
- O
a O
spice B-A
rub I-A
might O
have O
overwhelmed O
, O
however O
herb B-A
mix I-A
or O
other O
sauce B-A
would O
have O
done O
much O
to O
enhance O
. O

We O
were O
treated O
with O
attitude O
ever O
since O
the O
moment O
we O
stepped O
into O
the O
restaurant O
! O

After O
dinner B-A
, O
take O
your O
date O
to O
the O
HUGE O
dance B-A
floor I-A
, O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
you O
' O
ll O
see O
in O
NY O
. O

Taj O
Mahal O
offeres O
gret O
value B-A
and O
great O
food B-A
. O

Has O
the O
chef B-A
and O
owner B-A
changed O
??? O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
recently O
had O
an O
early O
dinner B-A
at O
Artisanal O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
our O
experience O
. O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
lived O
there O
as O
I O
would O
eat O
at O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
! O

But O
don O
' O
t O
ever O
order O
bacon B-A
late O
at O
nite O
( O
either O
platter B-A
or O
in B-A
sandwiches I-A
, O
for O
that O
matter O
don O
' O
t O
from O
any O
take O
out O
place O
) O
as O
it O
is O
from O
the O
morning O
frying B-A
turns O
out O
hard O
almost O
like O
bacos B-A
, O
hurt O
my O
molars O
. O

Outstanding O
Bagels B-A
, O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Pizza B-A
- O
the O
only O
pizza B-A
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings B-A
- O
the O
crust B-A
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread B-A
! O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
town O
, O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
searching O
for O
another O
place O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
the O
various O
slice O
joints O
around O
the O
village O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-A
to O
warm O
up O
. O

They O
even O
have O
a O
section O
in O
the O
menu B-A
called O
American B-A
Chinese I-A
food I-A
! O

Service B-A
was O
warm O
and O
attentive O
, O
beef B-A
carpaachio I-A
was O
exellent O
( O
huge O
portion B-A
) O
and O
pasta B-A
was O
fresh O
and O
well O
- O
prepared O
. O

kalbi B-A
and O
nebbiolo B-A
do O
work O
together O
. O

Best O
Italian B-A
food I-A
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
). O

I O
will O
recommend O
Scopa O
to O
all O
of O
my O
friends O
for O
a O
place O
to O
go O
for O
wonderful O
Italian B-A
food I-A
. O

Located B-A
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
time O
, O
effort O
, O
or O
money O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room B-A
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-A
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse B-A
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys O
! O

Hurley O
' O
s O
is O
terrific O
! O

They O
don O
' O
t O
walk O
around O
with O
the O
trays B-A
of I-A
Dim I-A
Sum I-A
. O

Took O
my O
sister O
here O
before O
attending O
a O
show O
one O
evening O
. O

Great O
bar B-A
, O
most O
gorgeous O
bar B-A
replaceendtenders I-A
you I-A
' I-A
ve I-A
ever I-A
seen I-A
( I-A
specifically I-A
the I-A
blond I-A
lady I-A
). I-A

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert B-A
but O
the O
waitress B-A
basically O
through O
the O
bill B-A
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

Really O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
' O
s O
the O
cheff B-A
gives O
to O
the O
food B-A
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

They O
came O
out O
over O
cooked O
and O
the O
cheese B-A
was O
almost O
non O
existant O
. O

I O
had O
a O
terrific O
meal B-A
, O
and O
our O
server B-A
guided O
us O
toward O
a O
very O
nice O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
replaceend O
in O
our O
price B-A
range I-A
, O
instead O
of O
allowing O
us O
to O
purchase O
a O
similarly O
priced B-A
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
replaceend O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
as O
good O
. O

The O
svc B-A
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
must O
! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

Never O
once O
did O
I O
leave O
feeling O
unwelcome O
or O
impressed O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes B-A
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-A
are O
delicious O
. O

But O
the O
main O
hit O
was O
the O
whole B-A
grilled I-A
fish I-A
. O

I O
had O
the O
tuna B-A
tartare I-A
with O
sake B-A
, O
mushroom B-A
ravioli I-A
with O
pinot B-A
noir I-A
, O
and O
the O
chocolate B-A
sampler I-A
with O
a O
dessert B-A
wine I-A
for O
$ O
49 O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
prepared O
along O
with O
the O
friendly O
and O
personable O
service B-A
. O

I O
usually O
go O
there O
later O
at O
night O
when O
I O
get O
off O
work O
so O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
crowds B-A
or O
lines B-A
. O

Pizza B-A
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B-A
and O
characters B-A
and O
ar O
food B-A
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

After O
2 O
tries O
by O
the O
waiter B-A
to O
take O
it O
away O
( O
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
even O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
, O
we O
had O
full O
beers B-A
yet O
to O
drink O
), O
the O
manager B-A
approached O
and O
told O
us O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
people O
with O
reservations B-A
. O

Wouldn O
' O
t O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner B-A
! O

Sauce B-A
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-A
didn O
' O
t O
have O
much O
flavor B-A
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoy O
Sangria B-A
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
' O
m O
eating O
indian B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-A
dish I-A
and O
they O
were O
served B-A
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

First O
the O
wrong O
bread B-A
came O
out O
with O
the O
appetizer B-A
, O
then O
when O
i O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
second O
glass B-A

main B-A
course I-A
... O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-A
and O
has O
great O
food B-A
! O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

Tell O
them O
Herky O
sent O
you O
and O
get O
a O
free O
confused O
look O
from O
the O
waiter B-A
. O

Make O
replacestart B-A
reservation I-A
replaceends I-A
but O
expect O
to O
be O
delayed O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
as O
the O
hosting B-A
staff I-A
was O
having O
difficulty O
seating B-A
guests O
who O
arrived O
with O
a O
reservation B-A
because O
they O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
walk O
ins O
being O
so O
close O
to O
Time O
Square O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-A
. O

They O
don O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials B-A
or O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai B-A
. O

Other O
apetizers B-A
and O
food B-A

The O
noodle B-A
and I-A
rices I-A
dishes I-A
taste O
great O
. O

The O
food B-A
' O
s O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
crust B-A
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-A
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-A
is O
friendly O
. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel B-A
place O
. O

the O
food B-A
was O
undercooked O
- O
the O
sauce B-A
watery O
, O
and O
the O
vegetables B-A
raw O
. O

And O
the O
fried B-A
clams I-A
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
to O
them O
to O
make O
' O
em O
worth O
eating O
. O

The O
sauces B-A
used O
are O
also O
not O
that O
exciting O
. O

The O
secret O
is O
the O
lunch B-A
menu I-A
which O
offers O
a O
complimentary O
appetizer B-A
with O
every O
entree B-A
ordered O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O
!!! O

The O
rice B-A
was O
poor O
quality B-A
and O
was O
cooked B-A
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
had O
champagne B-A
and O
caviar B-A
and O
felt O
like O
princesses O
! O

The O
shrimp B-A
scampi I-A
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-A
were O
plentiful O
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
to O
say O
the O
least O
and O
find O
such O
practice O
not O
worth O
the O
effort O
. O

When O
my O
dessert B-A
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-A
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

I O
got O
the O
$ O
10 O
10 O
- O
piece O
dim B-A
sum I-A
combo I-A
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

There O
are O
other O
Vietnamese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chinatown O
area O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
about O
those O
. O

There O
is O
also O
very O
limited O
seating B-A
and O
there O
can O
be O
a O
substantial O
wait B-A
in O
getting O
food B-A
at O
peak O
times O
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
just O
a O
quick O
martini B-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
( O
which O
I O
recommend O
Jeffery O
' O
s O
) O
or O
a O
mind O
blowing O
Roast B-A
Chicken I-A
, O
go O
to O
Village O
! O

No O
thanks O
!!! O

There O
was O
a O
long O
wait B-A
for O
a O
table B-A
outside O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde O
table B-A
was O
very O
nice O
. O

I O
would O
definently O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
prices B-A
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy B-A
food I-A
get O
the O
chicken B-A
vindaloo I-A
. O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
! O

I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
their O
true O
strength O
lays O
in O
their O
amazingly O
delicious O
and O
cheap O
lunch B-A
specials I-A
. O

So O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar B-A
food I-A
, O
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu B-A
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand B-A
- I-A
crafted I-A
beers I-A
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

And O
its O
absolutely O
DELICIOUS O
. O

No O
free O
drink B-A
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can O
' O
t O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
. O

Definitely O
Highly O
NOT O
recommended O
. O

While O
they O
keep O
the O
capex B-A
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B-A
, O
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs B-A
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B-A

They O
also O
have O
a O
back B-A
garden I-A
open O
in O
the O
summer O
- O
cute O
and O
French O
with O
outdoor B-A
seating I-A
- O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

go O
to O
any O
corned O
indian O

, O
and O
the O

I O
' O

an O

italian O
dinner B-A

my O
first O
time O
here O
was O
with O
my O
gf O
for O
our O
12 O
month O

While O
the O

the O

I O

walked O
by O
this O

for O

Have O
frequented O
' O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-A
remains O
excellent O

Their O
eggplant B-A
is O
so O
delicate O
, O
sweet O
tender O
! O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O
. O

Each O
bite O
of O
food B-A
at O
Kai O
was O
indeed O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
elegant O
. O

all O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
- O
considering O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-A
in O
most O
moderately O
priced B-A
restaurants O
is O
mediocre O
this O
was O
slightly O
more O
pricey O
and O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
save O
some O
money O
, O
don O
' O
t O
go O
here O
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-A
pizza I-A
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

I O
had O
the O
cod B-A
with I-A
paella I-A
( O
spicy O
and O
very O
filling O
, O
I O
' O
m O
a O
big O
eater O
and O
could O
only O
eat O
half O
) O
while O
my O

had O
the O

replacestart B-A
fish I-A
and O
chips O

( O

serving B-A
- O
at O

5 O
pieces O
of O
fish B-A
and O
a O
basketful O
of O

It O
' O
s O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
nice O
, O
convenient O
place B-A
like O
the O
Pink O
Pony O
can O
be O
so O
ruined O
by O
lousy O
service B-A
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Citysearch O
did O
' O
t O
call O
it O
right O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-A
. O

The O
porcini B-A
mushroom I-A
pasta I-A
special I-A
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-A
tagliatelle I-A
. O

Try O
the O
spicy B-A
wontons I-A
and O
the O
salt B-A
pepper I-A

THE O

a O
great O
stop O
for O
great O
food B-A
. O

All O
the O
pastas B-A
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
homemade B-A
lasagna I-A

some O
of O
the O
best O
that O
I O

had O
in O
the O
City O

What O
for O

us O
a O

and O
we O
left O
a O
10 O
percent O
tip B-A
, O
which O
was O
generous O
, O
I O
feel O
. O

And O
the O
prices B-A
were O
way O
to O
high O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

But O

The O

I O
the O
entire O
time O
we O
were O
there O
. O

Yet O
paired O
with O
such O
rude O

would O
never O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
interested O
in O
carrying O
any O
kind O

and O
quantity B-A
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
my O
friends O
meet O
me O
down O
here O
not O
only O
for O
the O
bar B-A
scene I-A
but O
also O
the O
promise O
of O
The O
Pizza O
Place O
at O
3am O
. O

Is O
just O
the O
way O
it O
was O
in O
days O
gone O
by O
. O

If O
I O
could O
rate O
the O
people B-A
this O
place O
would O
be O
off O
the O
charts O
- O
unfortunately O
- O
the O
pizza B-A
, O
sorry O
- O
not O
the O
best O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
amazing O
!!!! O

Having O
not O
been O
home O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
may O
skew O
this O
reviewer O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
was O
tasty O
and O
spicy O
sans O
the O
oil B-A
that O
comes O
floating O
along O
at O
similar O
venues O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
now O
very O
small O
, O
the O
sauces B-A
are O
overly O
- O
ambitious O
usually O
inedible O
while O
the O
service B-A
is O
still O
good O
, O
the O
restaurant O
, O
due O
to O
its O
popularity O
, O
seems O
frantic O
. O

For O
the O
price B-A
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
owner B-A
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
a O
great O
guy O
, O
go O
try O
his O
pizza B-A
, O
you O
' O
ll O
like O
it O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
great O
!!! O

It O
can O
be O
a O
very O
fun O
experience O
with O
a O
group O
, O
and O
kids O
( O
6 O
and O
over O
) O
would O
love O
it O
. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
need O
overpriced O
food B-A
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-A
- I-A
staff I-A
who O
don O
' O
t O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner B-A
, O
clumsy O
service B-A
, O
and O
management B-A
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
care O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-A
urchin I-A
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
a O
little O
scatty O
at O
times O
but O
all O
is O
forgiven O
when O
the O
food B-A
arrives O
. O

The O
bruscetta B-A
is O
a O
bit O
soggy O
, O
but O
the O
salads B-A
were O
fresh O
, O
included O
a O
nice O
mix B-A
of I-A
greens I-A
( O
not O
iceberg B-A
) O
all O
dishes B-A
are O
served B-A
piping O
hot O
from O
the O
kitchen O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis O
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
isn O
' O
t O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
' O
s O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices B-A
down O
. O

The O
pickles B-A
were O
great O
addition O
. O

If O
your O
favorite O
Chinese B-A
food I-A
is O
General B-A
Tao I-A
chicken I-A
, O
then O
this O
is O
NOT O
your O
place O
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-A
appetizers I-A
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-A
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-A
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

Filled O
with O
suits O
, O
though O
, O
so O
you O
never O
really O
feel O
terribly O
comfortable O
. O

The O
production O
is O
a O
symphony O
, O
alot O
of O
fun O
to O
experience O
. O
The O
food B-A
sublime O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

Waiters B-A
tend O
to O
forget O
drinks B-A
completely O
, O
food B-A
portions I-A
are O
so O
tiny O
, O
two O
people O
have O
trouble O
sharing O
one O
entree B-A
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
nyc O
for O
years O
and O
wouldn O
' O
t O
miss O
roxy O
, O
s O
food B-A
is O
expensive O
but O
it O
' O
s O
new O
york O
! O

It O
' O
s O
like O
you O
are O
transported O
to O
the O
Italian O
countryside O
, O
very O
romantic O
and O
filled O
with O
antiques O
. O

The O
cold B-A
appetizer I-A
dishes I-A
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

Just O
go O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-A
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Interesting O
selection O
, O
good O
wines B-A
, O
service B-A
fine O
, O
fun O
decor B-A
. O

I O
hate O
this O
. O

Any O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B-A
you O
' O
ll O
wait O
for O
max O
5 O
minutes O
- O
so O
have O
a O
drink B-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
. O

Whether O
it O
' O
s O
the O
parmesean B-A
porcini I-A
souffle I-A
or O
the O
lamb B-A
glazed I-A
with I-A
balsamic I-A
vinegar I-A
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
,,, O
sally O
! O

The O
food B-A
at O
this O
place O
is O
' B-A
gourmet I-A
' I-A
Indian I-A
cuisine I-A
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese O
restaurant O
! O

get O
over O
it O
! O

But O
the O
thing O
that O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
hated O
was O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
and O
it O
felt O
like O
' O
bar B-A
' O
or O
' O
pub B-A
'. O

However O
, O
it O
just O
so O
happens O
that O
there O
' O
s O
an O
even O
more O
amazing O
place O
just O
down O
the O
street O
. O

While O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
corned B-A
beef I-A
sandwich I-A
, O
Katz O
' O
s O
has O
a O
charm O
about O
it O
. O

However O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
ours O
, O
we O
both O
sort O
of O
wished O
we O
had O
ordered O
pizza B-A
, O
which O
looked O
PERRRRRRRRRFECT O
. O

Priced B-A
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

I O
recommend O
ordering O
in O
on O
a O
weeknight O
. O

If O
you O
live O
in O
new O
york O
city O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
find O
better O
food B-A
at O
small O
restaurants O
outside O
of O
time O
square O
and O
spend O
half O
the O
amount B-A
. O

Try O
the O
olive B-A
cream I-A
cheese I-A
or O
the O
lox B-A
spread I-A
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel B-A
. O

While O
it O
' O
s O
not O
Nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
my O
husband O
made O
up O
an O
excuse O
so O
we O
can O
leave O
. O

It O
' O
s O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

they O
didn O
' O
t O
disappoint O
, O
service B-A
from O
the O
second O
i O
arrived O
at O
the O
door O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
and O
attentive O
with O
almost O
one O
server B-A
per O
table B-A
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
who O
they O
think O
they O
are O
but O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
ever O
since O
they O
opened O
their O
cabaret O
next O
door O
and O
blasts O
loud O
music B-A
till O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
every O
weekend O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
rice I-A
to O
fish O
ration O
replaceend O
was O
also O
good O
-- O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice B-A
. O

They O
used O
shredded B-A
cheese I-A
on O
top O
! O

They O
are O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Chinatown O
! O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-A
of I-A
wines I-A
at O
reasonable O
prices B-A
. O

Eating O
at O
Ottimo O
is O
like O
eating O
in O
Chef O
Salvatore O
Esposito O
' O
s O
home O
. O

Katz O
' O
s O
deli O
is O
a O
great O
NY O
experience O
. O

Check O
it O
out O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
was O
the O
wait B-A
staff I-A
, O
which O
was O
prompt O
, O
knowledgable O
, O
and O
likeable O
. O

I O
couldn O
' O
t O
reccommend O
their O
Godmother B-A
pizza I-A
any O
higher O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-A
were O
great O
. O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
this O
low O
- O
key O
upper O
eastsider O
and O
their O
authentically O
thai B-A
cuisine I-A
!!! O

i O
would O
go O
again O
if O
i O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

For O
the O
location B-A
, O
the O
prices B-A
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices B-A
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

My O
friend O
' O
s O
food B-A
was O
also O
the O
complete O
opposite O
of O
what O
it O
' O
s O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
( O
aND O
look O
like O
). O

I O
ordered O
the O
crab B-A
cocktail I-A
and O
it O
was O
soaked O
in O
a O
replacestart B-A
lime I-A
juice O
concoction O
replaceend O
where O
all O
you O
could O
taste O
was O
the O
lime B-A
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
return O
and O
try O
some O
of O
the O
other O
menu B-A
items I-A
when O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
rush O
off O
to O
a O
show O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-A
, O
wine B-A
, O
and O
service B-A
. O

Hopefully O
next O
time O
, O
I O
will O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-A
. O

Alain O
Ducasse O
is O
the O
best O
of O
everything O
, O
I O
mean O
everything O
was O
excelent O
. O
I O

Not O
a O
typical O
pizza O
joint O
, O
but O
good O
for O
a O
low O
key O
and O
fairly O
cheap O
nice O
sit O
down O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
corned B-A
beef I-A
was O
tender O
and O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

GO O
HERE O

The O
best O
Chicken B-A
pad I-A
tai I-A

. O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
sushi B-A
cannot O
be O
beaten O
. O

It O
has O
been O
my O
first O
choice O
ever O
since O
I O
discovered O
it O
. O

Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O
. O

Haru O
serves O
very O
fresh O
fish B-A
, O
has O
a O
trendy O
, O
modern O
ambiance B-A
, O
prime O
location B-A
on O
Park O
Avenue O
South O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B-A
seating I-A
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

Very O
romantic O
fires O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
literally O
spent O
hours O
at O
Lanterna O
, O
drinking O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
replaceend O
from O
their O
extensive O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
replaceend O
and O
enjoying O
the O
ambience B-A
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B-A
but O
isn O
' O
t O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

I O
almost O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
go O
here O
and O
I O
could O
have O
all O
the O
dumplings B-A
to O
myself O
! O

After O
reading O
the O
posts O
, O
I O
was O
always O
skeptical O
to O
go O
to O
The O
Minnow O
, O
despite O
living O
in O
Park O
Slope O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-A
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

My O
turkey B-A
burger I-A
was O
not O
cooked O
at O
all O
, O
my O
friends O
salmon B-A
was O
completely O
raw O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
spotty O
, O
sometimes O
really O
friendly O
and O
sometimes O
barely O
there O
. O

Decor B-A
is O
minimalist O
and O
clean O
- O
nothing O
to O
distract O
or O
commend O
. O

His O
drinks B-A
are O
very O
inventive O
, O
delicious O
and O
classy O
. O

Great O
food B-A
, O
great O
prices B-A
, O
great O
service B-A
. O

This O
isn O
' O
t O
your O
corner O
Chinese B-A
food I-A
takeout O
. O

Awsome O
Pizza B-A
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-A
slice O
. O

This O
place B-A
, O
however O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
less O
pretension O
than O
Joya O
and O
the O
Thai B-A
food I-A
is O
still O
above O
- O
average O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
after O
reading O
reviews O
here O
as O
well O
as O
hobokeni O
. O
com O
, O

Try O
ordering O
from O
the O
regular O
menu B-A
, O
then O
you O
would O
not O
regret O
! O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table B-A
was O
reserved O
. O

uni O
from O
maine O
vs O
california O
, O
sea O
vs O
freshwater O
eel B-A
) O
to O
get O
a O
good O
taste O
comparison O
. O

We O
started O
with O
lox B-A
and O
mussels B-A
( O
the O
best O
ive O
ever O
had O
, O
ever O
) O
and O
had O
the O
cod B-A
and O
trout B-A
for O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
crispy B-A
chicken I-A
wasn O
' O
t O
for O
us O
, O
though O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Food B-A
is O
great O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
meatballs B-A
and O
caprese B-A
salad I-A
and O
the O
beans B-A
on I-A
toast I-A
were O
a O
wonderful O
start O
to O
the O
meal B-A
! O

This O
place B-A
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

I O
will O
definetely O
go O
back O
again O
and O
again O
, O
that O
' O
s O
for O
sure O
!!! O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-A
so O
much O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
our O
all O
- O
time O
favorite O
. O

In O
reality O
( O
to O
maximize O
potential O
diners B-A
) O
they O
were O
still O
taking O
phone O
reservations B-A
and O
reallocating O
tables B-A
of O
those O
waiting B-A
in O
the O
lobby B-A
. O

The O
wine B-A
is O
always O
good O
, O
the O
tapas B-A
are O
always O
yummy O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
warm O
pita B-A
bread I-A
. O

But O
when O
you O
are O
seated O
the O
waitresses B-A
are O
great O
, O
they O
explain O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
and O
the O
price B-A
of O
the O
food B-A
is O
really O
cheap O
for O
the O
service B-A
you O
get O
. O

this O
place O
is O
amazingly O
bad O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands O
- O
down O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
several O
places O
for O
Dim B-A
Sum I-A
and O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
WORST O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety B-A
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-A
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-A
and O
terrific O
food B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
super O
- O
trendy O
and O
there O
' O
s O
always O
someone O
to O
take O
that O
empty O
seat B-A
, O
so O
it O
seems O
that O
customer O
service B-A
has O
been O
deemed O
not O
of O
the O
essence O
. O

Dinner B-A
took O
almost O
4 O
hours O
without O
any O
lag O
time O
. O

The O
people B-A
in O
the O
restaurant O
were O
pretty O
obnoxious O
and O
loud O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-A
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
just O
that O
- O
it O
is O
a O
sometimes O
kind O
of O
affair O
. O

Price B-A
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

The O
fried B-A
rice I-A
is O
really O
good O
too O
. O

We O
were O
well O
attended O
to O
by O
the O
enthusiastic O
staff B-A
especially O
the O
manager B-A
Tony O
Gaskin O
who O
made O
excellent O
suggestions O
for O
our O
menu B-A
selections I-A
. O

Made O
my O
dining B-A
experience I-A
uncomfortable O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
steal O
! O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
based O
on O
prior O
internet O
comments O
. O

still O
stay O
away O
, O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
walked O
out O
after O
my O
table O
and O
aanother O
were O
serves B-A
eventhough O
they O
were O
there O
much O
longer O
... O

I O
was O
with O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
( O
close O
but O
not O
next O
the O
the O
front B-A
doors I-A
) O
and O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
our O
coats O
on O
. O

A O
very O
inviting O
restaurant O
, O
with O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

THe O
back B-A
garden I-A
sitting I-A
area I-A
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal B-A
herb I-A
garden I-A
. O

What O
' O
s O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

Will O
go O
back O
but O
only O
sate O
those O
homesick O
stomach O
cravings O
! O

Good O
French O
restaurant O
in O
an O
area O
devoid O
of O
decent O
restaurants O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
into O
eating O
4 O
pound O
pastrami B-A
sandwiches I-A
at O
Katz O
' O
Deli O
, O
or O
Mexican B-A
food I-A
which O
is O
supplied O
by O
capable O
restaurants O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
drinks B-A
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-A
selection I-A
is O
fairly O
priced B-A
. O

We O
also O
had O
shared O
a O
house B-A
salad I-A
that O
was O
fresh O
. O

The O
ceiling B-A
is O
amazing O
! O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NYC O
celebrating O
our O
30th O
anniversary O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

And O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
culinary O
nightmare O
the O
check B-A
was O
given O
to O
our O
table B-A
by O
knocking O
over O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
water I-A
. O

Not O
a O
small O
feat O
for O
good O
french B-A
food I-A
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
space B-A
is O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
live B-A
music I-A
, O
so O
on O
jazz B-A
nights I-A
, O
it O
can O
be O
loud O
and O
cramped O
. O

Food B-A
was O
average O
but O
tasty O
. O

We O
come O
from O
New O
Jersey O
to O
eat O
at O
Kinoko O
. O

Big O
Wong O
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment B-A
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

The O
entree B-A
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B-A
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Oh O
and O
it O
' O
s O
too O
tiny O
for O
families O
with O
strollers O
. O

The O
staff B-A
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-A
salad I-A
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B-A
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-A
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places B-A
. O

Delicious O
food B-A
at O
a O
great O
price B-A
but O
do O
not O
go O
here O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
and O
sit O
by O
the O
front B-A
door I-A
. O

my O
picks O
: O
Guizhou B-A
chicken I-A
, O
fish B-A
with I-A
hot I-A

source I-A
, O
fish B-A
fillet I-A
in I-A
spicy I-A
source I-A
( O
special B-A
menu I-A
). O

Overall O
, O
I O
' O
m O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
, O
its O
Chinatown O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-A
kitchen I-A
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

Pizza B-A
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

The O
food B-A
inludes O
famous O
scrumptious O
bombay B-A
style I-A
chaat I-A
such O
as O
bhelpuri B-A
, O
sevpuri B-A
and O
samosa B-A
chaats I-A
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
great O
indian B-A
appetizers I-A
. O

The O
Singapore B-A
Mai I-A
Fun I-A
had O
NO O
curry B-A
flavor I-A
whatsoever O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-A
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

Murray O
won O
' O
t O
do O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-A
. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner B-A
location I-A
. O

Definite O
go O
if O
you O
' O
re O
used O
to O
good O
Indian B-A
restaurant I-A
food I-A
from O
abroad O
. O

THR O
AT B-A
MOSHPHERE I-A
IS O
COMPACT O
, O
MODERN O
, O
YET O
COZY O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Decent O
Thai B-A
food I-A
in O
cute O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
dank O
- O
little O
Nolita O
hangout O
, O
BUT O
service B-A
terrible O
. O

Most O
people O
eat O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
typical O
Upper O
East O
Side O
snobs O
, O
so O
be O
aware O
. O

The O
waiter B-A
actually O
poured O
water B-A
on O
my O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
mostly O
made O
from O
scratch O
, O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

Worse O
of O
all O
, O
$ O
60 O
was O
erroneously O
added O
to O
our O
$ O
80 O
bill B-A
. O

Too O
cold O
to O
enjoy O
. O

NO O
more O
reservations B-A
, O
expensive O
tips B-A
and O
annoying O
stuff B-A
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-A
bass I-A
. O

$ O
20 O
gets O
you O
unlimited O
sushi B-A
of O
a O
very O
high O
quality B-A
- O
I O
even O
took O
a O
friend O
here O
from O
Japan O
who O
said O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
sushi B-A
places O
in O
the O
US O
that O
he O
has O
been O
to O
. O

I O
brought O
some O
buddies O
from O
CA O
and O
they O
loved O
it O
. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Sushi B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
anything O
spectacular O
for O
the O
price B-A
. O

During O
our O
meal B-A
, O
the O
management B-A
came O
over O
and O
checked O
on O
us O
and O
even O
bought O
us O
a O
round B-A
of I-A
drinks I-A
. O

But O
they O
don O
' O
t O
have O
a O
toaster B-A
, O
which O
is O
strange O
. O

So O
, O
for O
good O
food B-A
i O
' O
d O
recommend O
it O
, O
but O
not O
for O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
. O

The O
menu B-A
choices I-A
are O
similar O
but O
the O
taste B-A
lacked O
more O
flavor B-A
than O
it O
looked O
. O

A O
must O
for O
all O
the O
Dosa B-A
lovers O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer B-A
and O
entree B-A
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

The O
appetizers B-A
are O
just O
OK O
and O
the O
main B-A
courses I-A
were O
decidedly O
subpar O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-A
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

The O
exotic B-A
food I-A
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
we O
can O
almost O
always O
get O
a O
table B-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
, O
this O
really O
isn O
' O
t O
a O
good O
place O
to O
go O
. O

Try O
the O
mediterranean B-A
salad I-A
, O
it O
is O
a O
true O
experience O
for O
your O
taste O
buds O
!! O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
I O
' O
ll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

People B-A
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

The O
cream B-A
cheeses I-A
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-A
!! O

From O
the O
entrees B-A
to O
the O
sides B-A
to O
the O
drinks B-A
, O
everything O
was O
creatively O
prepared O
yet O
still O
simple O
. O

hmmm O
. O

Service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

It O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
replacestart B-A
beef I-A
version O
replaceend O
had O
cheap O
( O
undercooked O
) O
beef B-A
. O

Chance O
is O
a O
small O
cozy O
restaurant O
, O
with O
a O
romantic O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
the O
decor B-A
is O
great O
. O

It O
was O
nice O
and O
fresh O
, O
but O
I O
can O
' O
t O
give O
it O
high O
scores O
on O
being O
authentic O
thai B-A
. O

Overall O
, O
worht O
every O
penny O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

Got O
club B-A
soda I-A
, I-A
filled I-A
with I-A
ice I-A
, I-A
no I-A
lime I-A
. O

Only O
wine B-A
and O
beer B-A
are O
served B-A
, O
but O
the O
house B-A
varities I-A
are O
actually O
quite O
good O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost B-A
the O
owners B-A
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

My O
mouth O
starts O
to O
water O
merely O
thinking O
about O
the O
delight O
that O
is O
this O
restaurant O
. O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
complimentary O
pudding B-A
dessert I-A
was O
just O
enough O
- O
yummy O
! O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

we O
split O
a O
tasty O
vegetable B-A
samosa I-A
and O
the O
malai B-A
tikka I-A
wrap I-A
. O

Knowledge O
of O
the O
chef B-A
and O
the O
waitress B-A
are O
below O
average O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks B-A
. O

Decent O
wine B-A
selection I-A
too O
. O

Go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
time O
. O

It O
saves O
walking O
in O
and O
waiting B-A
for O
a O
table B-A
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
, O
crowded O
bar B-A
at O
dinnertime O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-A
here O
. O

It O
' O
s O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
place O
does O
get O
crowded O
, O
so O
I O
recommend O
going O
between O
4 O
- O
5 O
PM O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat B-A
cheese I-A
and O
panchetta B-A
( O
raddichio B-A
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
). O

Disappointing O
food B-A
, O
lousy O
service B-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
from O
sichuan O
, O
this O
is O
the O
restaurant O
I O
recommend O
going O
. O

This O
lovely O
French O
- O
Asian O
fusion O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
amongst O
other O
great O
restaurants O
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O
bistro O
that O
has O
great O
food B-A
and O
excellent O
service B-A
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink B-A
too O
because O
they O
have O
100 O
kinds B-A
of I-A
beer I-A
. O

But O
this O
place O
is O
a O
well O
- O
oiled O
machine O
so O
they O
know O
what O
they O
' O
re O
doing O
. O

Over O
price B-A
, O
and O
small O
portions B-A
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
bartender B-A
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne B-A
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O
bottle O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
an O
amuse O
of O
turnip B-A
soup I-A
with I-A
pureed I-A
basil I-A
, O
gratis O
. O

But O
I O
' O
d O
go O
back O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-A
impecable O
. O

BUt O
their O
best O
replacestart B-A
dish I-A
replaceend O
is O
thh O
Thai B-A
spiced I-A
curry I-A
noodles I-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
- O
a O
replacestart B-A
dish I-A
replaceend O
that O
would O
cost B-A
$ O
23 O
. O
95 O
is O
most O
places O
, O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
16 O
here O
. O

Good O
, O
dark O
atmosphere B-A
and O
the O
music B-A
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
the O
replacestart B-A
portion I-A
replaceends I-A
were O
very O
small O
, O
but O
if O
my O
main B-A
course I-A
was O
good O
to O
eat O
the O
portion B-A
would O
' O
ve O
been O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

But O
the O
thai B-A
is O
definitely O
not O
great O
-- O
bland O
and O
indistinguished O
. O

This O
Thai O
restaurant O
is O
a O
couple O
blocks O
away O
from O
Sripraphai O
( O
another O
delicious O
Thai O
restaurant O
). O

Great O
for O
groups O
, O
great O
for O
a O
date O
, O
great O
for O
early O
brunch B-A
or O
a O
nightcap B-A
. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Our O
friendly O
server B-A
made O
great O
food B-A
suggestions I-A
and O
also O
sent O
both O
the O
sommelier B-A
and O
the O
fromager B-A
to O
the O
table O
to O
help O
suggest O
different O
pairings O
for O
wine B-A
and O
cheese B-A
. O

Perhaps O
the O
last O
reviewer O
( O
who O
stated O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
attitude O
) O
lives O
in O
a O
parallel O
universe O
because O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
a O
perfect O
experience O
at O
Yasuda O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
thought O
Scalini O
Fedeli O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
dining O
experiences O
I O
' O
ve O
EVER O
had O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant O
was O
special O
. O

Because O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-A
, O
we O
could O
only O
sit O
in O
the O
back B-A
garden I-A
, O
but O
it O
was O
great O
, O
secluded O
and O
perfect O
in O
nice O
weather O
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese B-A
food I-A
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

I O
try O
my O
best O
to O
give O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
any O
establishment O
visited O
. O

While O
the O
food B-A
was O
good O
( O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
) O
the O
service B-A
was O
horrendous O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Service B-A
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B-A
category I-A
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B-A
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations B-A
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O

. O

Great O
pizza B-A
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
very O
expensive O
( O
we O
spent O
$ O
160 O
for O
lunch B-A
for O
two O
) O
but O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
8 O
and O
well O
seved B-A
. O

And O
that O
' O
s O
no O
mean O
feat O
... O

I O
often O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
family O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

The O
signs B-A
, O
the O
specials B-A
menus I-A
, O
food B-A
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-A
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

NO O
PIZZA O
33 O
for O
me O
! O

I O
LOVE O
their O
spicy O
scallop B-A
roll I-A
, O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
consistently O
gets O
the O
sesame B-A
chicken I-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
no O
food B-A
critic O
, O
but O
I O
' O
d O
like O
to O
think O
I O
have O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
experience O
under O
my O
belt O
having O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
the O
last O
11 O
years O
. O

I O
noted O
it O
was O
crossed O
off O
on O
the O
bill B-A
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
' O
m O
never O
going O
back O
and O
you O
should O
be O
wary O
too O
. O

Best O
dish B-A
is O
nori B-A
- I-A
wrapped I-A
tuna I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
!! O

Some O
servers B-A
make O
you O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
doing O
you O
a O
favor O
to O
bring O
you O
the O
food B-A
. O

An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B-A
replacestart I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
slightly O
disappointing O
. O

Mermaid O
Inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-A
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
another O
couple O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
also O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
all B-A
you I-A
can I-A
eat I-A
deal I-A
is O
truly O
amazing O
here O
. O

That O
is O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
paid O
about O
20 O
bucks O
a O
dish B-A
, O
and O
had O
to O
order O
5 O
dish B-A
replaceendes I-A
to I-A
get I-A
a I-A
decent I-A
replacestart I-A
taste I-A
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
place O
that O
provides O
the O
best O
experience O
, O
though O
, O
to O
both O
A O
- O
listers O
and O
people O
walking O
in O
off O
the O
street O
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip O
- O
off O
($ O
8 O
. O
95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat B-A
patties I-A
in I-A
steamed I-A
buns I-A
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-A
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price B-A
is O
even O
better O
! O

It O
is O
about O
FOOD B-A
and O
Ambiance B-A
, O
and O
imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O
will O
be O
it O
we O
only O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
an O
idle O
engine O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
too O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

The O
dining B-A
room I-A
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music B-A
to O
shout O
over O
-- O
how O
refreshing O
! O

Admittedly O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
gigantic O
pieces O
of O
fish B-A
overflowing O
the O
plate O
( O
and O
thank O
goodness O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
) O
but O
for O
simple O
, O
elegant O
sushi B-A
there O
is O
no O
better O
place O
in O
New O
York O
or O
anywhere O
in O
the O
US O
. O

I O
am O
a O
die O
hard O
peep O
lover O
. O

Once O
you O
become O
a O
regular O
, O
you O
are O
treated O
as O
one O
. O

The O
menu B-A
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
wide O
variety B-A
of I-A
dishes I-A
for O
seafood B-A
lovers O
and O
interesting O
ways O
of O
preparing O
them O
. O

Everyone O
treats O
you O
like O
you O
were O
part O
of O
the O
family O
. O

The O
white B-A
bean I-A
brushetta I-A
to O
start O
was O
incredible O
and O
the O
pasta B-A
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B-A
is O
limited O
by O
everything O
is O
good O
eats B-A
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
one O
on O
the O
website O
. O

Great O
food B-A
, O
great O
lay B-A
out I-A
and O
awesome O
service B-A
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-A
attendant I-A
for O
a O
lotus B-A
leaf I-A
wrapped I-A
replacestart I-A
rice I-A
replaceend O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice B-A
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

SEA O
has O
become O
so O
popular O
that O
they O
' O
ve O
let O
it O
go O
to O
their O
heads O
. O

We O
walked O
in O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B-A
promptly O
. O

Chennai O
Garden O
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
' O
re O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
ever O
on O
the O
west O
side O
try O
there O
sister O
resturant O
Arties O
Cafe O
. O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
). O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-A
are O
all O
very O
busy O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
outstanding O
service B-A
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
dealt O
with O
rudely O
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste B-A
of O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
feel B-A
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
-- O
great O
price B-A
, O
food B-A
, O
and O
service B-A
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

This O
was O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
night O
. O

Its O
also O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
to O
without O
a O
car O
( O
I O
happen O
to O
live O
in O
Inwood O
). O

The O
flavors B-A
are O
great O
, O
and O
the O
menu B-A
is O
extensive O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
amazing O
, O
the O
service B-A
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
, O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience B-A
! O

This O
place B-A
has O
the O
best O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
interior O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
I O
have O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
the O
northside O
of O
W O
' O
burg O
, O
and O
will O
impress O
whoever O
you O
bring O
there O
. O

The O
food B-A
has O
been O
consistant O
for O
years O
and O
it O
never O
lets O
you O
down O
. O

I O
found O
the O
variety O
of O
the O
sashimi B-A
plate I-A
to O
be O
satisfying O
- O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
. O

And O
forget O
what O
you O
read O
under O
me O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-A
isn O
' O
t O
that O
bad O
either O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
time O
, O
or O
money O
!! O

They O
don O
' O
t O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
' O
s O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

We O
couldn O
' O
t O
carry O
our O
conversation O
as O
we O
were O
routinely O
interrupted O
by O
waitress B-A
and O
servants B-A
asking O
us O
to O
order O
and O
hinting O
that O
we O
' O
re O
taking O
too O
much O
time O
-- O
amazing O
, O
we O
just O
sat O
down O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B-A
and O
ok O
service B-A
. O

We O
just O
ate O
at O
Kai O
and O
were O
disapointed O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
mediocre O
food B-A
, O
noise B-A
and O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
with O
their O
fellow O
bridge O
and O
tunnel O
folks O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

After O
complaining O
about O
the O
chicken B-A
replacestart I-A
dish I-A
replaceend O
, O
the O
manager B-A
came O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
, O
no O
one O
had O
ever O
complained O
before O
, O
and O
that O
we O
just O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
what O
the O
dish B-A
was O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
spicy O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
fiance O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Went O
for O
a O
late O
weekday O
lunch B-A
. O

I O
just O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

Bartender B-A
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
himself O
away O
from O
friends O
at O
bar B-A
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food B-A
, O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

Dahkin O
also O
offers O
prix B-A
fixe I-A
lunch I-A
and O
buffet B-A
. O

Although O
the O
place B-A
could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
eye O
catching O
and O
roomier O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
doesn O
' O
t O
really O
matter O
. O

You O
can O
barely O
see O
who O
you O
are O
with O
never O
mind O
have O
a O
conversation O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
get O
it O
either O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
double O
date O
with O
friend O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-A
and O
appetizers B-A
. O

Great O
place O
to O
grab O
a O
hot B-A
bagel I-A
on O
the O
way O
to O
work O
. O

It O
' O
s O
like O
they O
took O
leftover O
chicken B-A
, O
poured O
oil B-A
and O
sprinkled O
pepper B-A
powder I-A
over O
it O
( O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
translucent O
and O
red O
). O

One O
would O
think O
we O
' O
d O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B-A
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-A
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

They O
brought O
glasses O
and O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
just O
left O
the O
bottle O
at O
our O
table O
. O

We O
actually O
gave O
10 O
% O
tip B-A
( O
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
), O
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O
. O

We O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
nice O
glass B-A
of I-A
Sangria I-A
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B-A
by I-A
the I-A
window I-A
. O

While O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-A
, O
we O
were O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
replacestart B-A
service I-A
replaceend O
( O
waiter B-A
was O
not O
quite O
competent O
and O
SLOW O
replacestart B-A
service I-A
replaceend O
) O
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O
. O

I O
for O
one O
will O
never O
patronize O
them O
again O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

The O
service B-A
, O
however O
, O
was O
a O
bright O
flower O
in O
a O
garden O
. O

So O
, O
again O
, O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

Stay O
far O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

We O
will O
come O
back O
!!! O

We O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Grocery O
three O
times O
and O
not O
once O
has O
an O
item O
on O
the O
menu B-A
disappointed O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
is O
very O
good O
too O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
' O
s O
just O
regular O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
, O
nothing O
special O
. O

A O
touch O
more O
jalapeno B-A
heat O
for O
contrast O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
good O
indeed O
. O

Tried O
the O
pad B-A
see I-A
ew I-A
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
last O
reviewer O
since O
it O
' O
s O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes B-A
. O

We O
' O
d O
go O
back O
again O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-A
patio I-A
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
' O
s O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-A
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

The O
location B-A
is O
perfect O
. O

Guacamole B-A
+ I-A
shrimp I-A
appetizer I-A
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
replacestart B-A
filet I-A
replaceend O
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-A
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
replacestart B-A
filet I-A
replaceend O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

The O
lunch B-A
special I-A
is O
an O
asbolute O
steal O
. O

This O
food B-A
is O
asian O

air O
fusion O
. O

Nothing O
fancy O
but O
really O
good O
food B-A
with O
pretty O
reasonable O
price B-A
. O

The B-A
chicken I-A
pot I-A
pie I-A
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B-A
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

While O
I O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
Michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O
. O

i O
' O
m O
surprised O
about O
some O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
posted O
here O
- O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
tamarind O
about O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
and O
always O
come O
away O
extremely O
satisfied O
and O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O
. O

But O
on O
a O
lazy O
Saturday O
night O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
Italian O
employees B-A
who O
may O
not O
speak O
the O
best O
English O
but O
for O
me O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

Once O
for O
dinner B-A
and O
once O
for O
brunch B-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe O
Spice O
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

Not O
worth O
the O
prices B-A
. O

Would O
recommend O
- O
perfect O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
close O
to O
grand O
central O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
enter O
till O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
out O
the O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff B-A
was O
was O
just O
Fantastic O
. O

Service B-A
was O
good O
and O
food B-A
is O
wonderful O
. O

I O
only O
have O
friends O
. O

She O
gets O
10 O
for O
her O
excellent O
service B-A
and O
advice O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-A

being O
a O
fan O
of O
spicy B-A
ethnic I-A
foods I-A
, O
indian O
included O
, O
i O
made O
friends O
with O
this O
place O
long O
ago O
. O

Please O
save O
yourself O
the O
frustration O
. O

And O
I O
say O
snacking B-A
because O
it O
really O
is O
not O
set O
up O
to O
be O
a O
proper O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
quality B-A
of I-A
food I-A
at O
this O
restaurant O
accompanied O
by O
fantastic O
live B-A
jazz I-A
makes O
this O
place O
a O
perfect O
10 O
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

( O
Always O
ask O
the O
bartender B-A
for O
the O
SEASONAL B-A
beer I-A
!!! O

If O
your O
visiting O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
enjoy O
the O
ambiance B-A
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
' O
s O
in O
Time O
Sq O
... O

We O
were O
on O
our O
way O
back O
to O
NJ O
, O
and O
since O
I O
am O
in O
NY O
, O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
grab O
some O
food B-A
? O

sandwiches B-A
tho O
pricey O
are O
over O
stuffed O
- O
can O
serve O
2 O
persons O
easily O
thus O
cost O
effective O
! O

And O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
is O
simply O
not O
fair O
. O

Service B-A
and O
food B-A
is O
what O
any O
one O
would O
expect O
when O
spending O
that O
type O
of O
money O
. O

LOVE O
the O
atmosphere B-A
- O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
Paris O
. O

Every O
course B-A
was O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

Not O
cheap O
, O
but O
not O
that O
expensive O
either O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
. O

If O
presentation O
and O
service B-A
is O
your O
thing O
, O
then O
this O
magic O
show O
works O
. O

Apparently O
, O
the O
good O
cook B-A
works O
then O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-A
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

One O
less O
manhattanite O
the O
better O
. O

Everyone O
is O
welcomed O
in O
as O
family O
. O

I O
ate O
clams B-A
oreganta I-A
and O
spectacular O
salad B-A
with I-A
perfectly I-A
marinated I-A
cucumbers I-A
and I-A
tomatoes I-A
with I-A
lots I-A
of I-A
shrimp I-A
and I-A
basil I-A
. O

The O
menu B-A
changed O
, O
portions B-A
were O
even O
smaller O
than O
before O
, O
a O
lentil B-A
dish I-A
was O
salty O
beyond O
edibility O
, O
a O
basmati B-A
rice I-A
dish I-A
lacked O
flavor B-A
. O

Spice O
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
cool O
with O
a O
menu B-A
that O
will O
not O
hurt O
your O
wallet O
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-A
bar I-A
and O
has O
great O
staff B-A
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2 O
+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ain O
' O
t O
bad O
. O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-A
! O

Look O
elsewhere O
. O

More O
important O
, O
the O
sushi B-A
rivals O
the O
best O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-A
like O
this O
. O

Bill B-A
a O
little O
high O
, O
but O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
seriously O
doubt O
I O
will O
ever O
dine O
at O
Jimmy O
' O
s O
Bronx O
, O
or O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
Jimmy O
' O
s O
Uptown O
, O
again O
. O

Everyone O
I O
bring O
here O
always O
loves O
it O
. O

My O
co O
- O
workers O
had O
to O
wait O
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
delivery B-A
, O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
what O
they O
got O
was O
not O
what O
they O
ordered O
. O

Worth O
a O
visit O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

Its O
a O
go O
- O
to O
for O
dates O
as O
well O
as O
entertaining B-A
out O
of O
town O
guests O
. O

Why O
do O
people O
rave O
about O
the O
ambience B-A
. O

Were O
meeting O
up O
with O
some O
friends O
for O
a O
drink B-A
at O
Lafayette O
161 O
and O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
Thai O
Angel O
famished O
. O

Fluke B-A

the O

of I-A
the I-A

nicely O
highlighting O
the O

Great O
sushi B-A
experience O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
meal B-A
at O
a O
decent O
price B-A
, O
go O
to O
Del O
Frisco O
' O
s O
! O

They O
charge O
$ O
6 O
. O
00 O
for O
rice B-A
. O

My O
steak B-A
au I-A
poivre I-A
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant O
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

The O
owner B-A
and O
staff B-A
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-A
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-A
and O
the O
donut B-A
like I-A
deep I-A
fried I-A
dough I-A
they I-A
call I-A
Ow I-A
Ley I-A
Soh I-A
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread B-A
. O

Although O
the O
tables B-A
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-A
- I-A
light I-A
, O
food B-A
- I-A
quality I-A
and O
service B-A
overcompensate O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
( O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O
). O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-A
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-A
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

Would O
definitely O
visit O
again O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

Perhaps O
this O
food B-A
is O
considered O
extreme O
to O
an O
Upper O
East O
Side O
resident O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
who O
' O
ve O
actually O
eaten O
ethnic O
food B-A
, O
this O
is O
simply O
dull O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
Sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O
. O

This O
little O
place B-A
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
rereplacestart O

for O
your O

. O

Ambience B-A
is O
delightful O
, O
service B-A
impeccable O
. O

Service B-A
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
AC B-A
worked O
very O
well O
too O
( O
thank O
God O
, O
it O
was O
hot O
!). O

Tasty O
but O
expensive O
. O

You O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
people B-A
there O
care O
about O
their O
restaurant O
and O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
that O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Both O
are O
delicious O
, O
the O
cooks B-A
are O
friendly O
and O
are O
willing O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
and O
speak O
to O
you O
and O
shake O
your O
hand O
. O

so O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
change O
it O
up O
a O
bit O
. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
some O
of O
their O
special O
sushi B-A
rolls I-A
which O
had O
excellent O
presentation O
and O
tasted O
great O
! O

Although O
be O
warned O
their O
dinner B-A
menu I-A
to I-A
sit I-A
and O
take B-A
out I-A
prices B-A
are O
different O
. O

The O

P O
. O
S O
. O
Please O
don O
' O
t O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

my O
picks O
are O
: O
- O
Scallion B-A
Pancake I-A
( O
fried O
with O
vegetable B-A
juice I-A
, O
very O
special O
and O
tasty O
) O
- O
Guizhou B-A
Chicken I-A
- O
Shredded B-A
Squid I-A
Family I-A
Style I-A
( O
one O
of O
my O
personal O
favorites O
) O
- O
Sichuan B-A
Spicy I-A
Soft I-A
Shell I-A
Crab I-A
- O
Shuizhu B-A
Fish I-A
( O
this O
one O
is O
for O
hardcore O
Sichuan B-A
food I-A
fans O
, O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
recommend O
to O
my O
American O
friends O
as O
it O
' O
s O
very O
spicy O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned B-A
vegetables I-A
like O
the O
spinach B-A
mushroom I-A
calzone I-A
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food B-A
. O

There O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
6 O
Blue B-A
Point I-A
oysters I-A
and O
a O
beer B-A
or O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
for O
$ O
8 O
! O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
noodle B-A
dishes I-A
at O
Rice O
Avenue O
compared O
to O
their O
Green B-A
Curry I-A
dish I-A
. O

I O
went O
to O
pams O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
, O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O

But O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
prices B-A
are O
about O
twice O
as O
high O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-A
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-A
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Great O
atmoshere B-A
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

We O
had O
a O
most O
unpleasant O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A
roll I-A
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-A
shrimp I-A
tempura I-A
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer B-A
to O
share O
! O

The O
staff B-A
was O
knowledgeable O
and O
full O
of O
personality O
. O

Great O
staff B-A
. O

Only O
complaint O
would O
be O
that O
at O
an O
average O
cost B-A
of O
$ O
12 O
-$ O
15 O
per O
meal B-A
, O
I O
' O
d O
like O
not O
to O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
finding O
a O
seat B-A
! O

To O
finish O
off O
such O
a O
delightful O
dinner B-A
experience O
you O
must O
have O
dessert B-A
, O
especially O
the O
White B-A
Chocolate I-A
Bread I-A
Pudding I-A
with I-A
Gelato I-A
and I-A
hot I-A
chocolate I-A
. O

The O
banana B-A
tower I-A
is O
an O
amazing O
dessert B-A
as O
well O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-A
, O
delicious O
dishes B-A
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

A O
cool O
place B-A
to O
hang O
with O
your O
friends O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
healthy O
drinks B-A
and O
desserts B-A
. O

Great O
vibe B-A
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

I O
like O
Mamoun O
' O

replacestart B-A

replaceend O
as O
well O

but O

, O
Kati O

just O
produce O
tastier O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
hands O
down O
. O

Just O
an O
odd O
group O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
harkens O
back O
to O
my O
years O
growing O
up O
in O
Napoli O
, O
Italy O
where O
things O
are O
not O
rushed O
and O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
for O
dinner B-A
the O
table B-A
is O
yours O
all O
night O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
' O
s O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

But O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
icing B-A
on I-A
the I-A
cake I-A
: O
a O
tiramisu B-A
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Great O
food B-A
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Wine B-A
list I-A
is O
not O
huge O
but O
def O
well O
selected O
. O

A O
cool O
bar B-A
with O
great O
food B-A
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B-A
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B-A
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
authentic O
and O
relaxing O
and O
we O
have O
always O
received O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
service B-A
. O

Fresh O
, O
authentic O
, O
french B-A
cuisine I-A
in O
substantial O
portions B-A
. O

Drinks B-A
got O
screwed O
up O

The O
one O
vegetarian B-A
entree I-A
( O
Abby B-A
' I-A
s I-A
treasure I-A
) O
was O
actually O
quite O
a O
surprise O
- O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
had O
wintermelon B-A
covering O
an O
assortment B-A
of I-A
fresh I-A
mushrooms I-A
and I-A
vegetables I-A
. O

At O
5 O
dumplings B-A
for O
$ O
1 O
, O
you O
just O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-A
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

And O
the O
staff B-A
is O
also O
young O
, O
energeic O
and O
hot O
!!!! O

Even O
better O
, O
they O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
French O
classics O
like O
Steak B-A
au I-A
Poivre I-A
and O
Onglet B-A
without O
burning O
it O
to O
death O
or O
overcooking O
it O
. O

Service B-A
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
as O
smooth O
as O
I O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
place O
with O
these O
prices B-A
and O
reputation B-A
. O

We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal B-A
at O
Naples O
45 O
a O
month O
ago O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
NYC O
. O

Good O
drink B-A
. O

Great O
food B-A
( O
spinach B-A
and I-A
corn I-A
dumplings I-A
and O
massamman B-A
curry I-A
), O
very O
friendly O
and O
no O
nonsense O
service B-A
and O
a O
clean O
and O
funky O
bathroom B-A
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

We O
had O
a O
girls O
' O
night O
dinner B-A
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

Romantic O
if O
you O
want O
it O
to O
be O
( O
brightly O
lit O
). O

However O
, O
I O
was O
there O
for O
a O
work O
dinner B-A
not O
long O
ago O
when O
my O
colleague O
from O
London O
noticed O
a O
very O
large O
waterbug O
on O
the O
ceiling B-A
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
have O
taken O
practically O
every O
guest O
that O
has O
come O
to O
visit O
me O
in O
NY O
and O
hooked O
a O
few O
New O
Yorkers O
onto O
Peep O
as O
well O
. O

enough O
said O
! O

I O
don O
' O
t O
live O
in O
NY O
but O
my O
best O
friend O
does O
. O

My O
chow B-A
fun I-A
and I-A
chow I-A
see I-A
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
made O
the O
reservation B-A
at O
3pm O
for O
the O
same O
night O
through O
Dinnerbroker O
, O
we O
were O
seated B-A
at O
a O
table B-A
with O
one O
of O
the O
best O
view O
! O

we O
did O
notice O
however O
, O
that O
some O
tables O
had O
what O
looked O
like O
pita B-A
instead O
of O
naan B-A
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
rest O
menu B-A
, O
but O
the O
oysters B-A
were O
fantastic O
. O

After O
the O
review O
I O
treked O
into O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
grilled B-A
cheese I-A
at O
home O
afterwards O
was O
better O
.!! O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
greeted O
. O

The O
red O
sliding O
doors B-A
may O
be O
unique O
but O
they O
do O
not O
block O
off O
the O
cold O
air O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

Great O
service B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
expensive O
, O
but O
worth O
every O
bite O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O

sometimes O

When O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
our O

came O
by O
twice O

1 O
for O
our O
order O
and O

In O
summer O

on O
a O

( O
another O
great O

of O
Suan O
)!!! O

It O

We O
did O
have O
to O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-A
. O

Dakshin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
affordable O
and O
tasty O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices B-A
all O
the O
time O
. O

To O
dine O
at O
Thalia O
can O
be O
slightly O
deceiving O
because O
while O
its O
beautiful O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
its O
so O
bland O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service B-A
and O
overpriced O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
experienced O
amazing O
cheese B-A
and O
a O
delicious O
, O
new O
summer O
menu B-A
at O
Artisanal O
last O
night O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

It O
' O
s O
charmingly O
small O
and O
that O
leads O
to O
an O
atmoshere B-A
that O
is O
extremely O
cozy O
and O
romantic O
, O
even O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
food B-A
itself O
-- O
nothing O
special O
, O
we O
limited O
ourselves O
to O
several O
appetizers B-A
. O

Love O
the O
Jazz B-A
bands I-A
on O
Fri O
and O
Sat O
. O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant O
! O

To O
begin O
, O
we O
were O
told O
there O
was O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-A
and O
started O
to O
leave O
, O
when O
the O
hostess B-A
offered O
to O
call O
us O
on O
our O
cell O
phone O
when O
the O
table B-A
was O
ready O
. O

The O
servers B-A
give O
you O
some O
sample O
slices O
of O
your O
order O
while O
you O
wait O
( O
shortly O
I O
might O
add O
). O

The O
service B-A
was O
ok O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish B-A
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O
While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
absolutely O
loved O
it O
! O

Don O
' O
t O
expect O
to O
sit O
down O
inside O
though O
, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
tables B-A
and O
they O
are O
always O
full O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
accomodating O
, O
the O
ambiance B-A
is O
exciting O
and O
yet O
relaxed O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-A
special I-A
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-A
), O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

The O
manager B-A
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill B-A
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

Satisfying O
. O

Highly O
Highly O
Highly O

it O
' O
s O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O

comfort I-A
food I-A
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-A
price I-A
sushi I-A
deal I-A
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

we O
came O
here O
on O
a O
crowded O
saturday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B-A
right O
away O
despite O
being O
15 O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation B-A
. O

This O
place O
is O
cool O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
French O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
could O
be O
in O
a O
bistro O
in O
a O
back O
alley O
in O
Paris O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer B-A
platter I-A
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
staff B-A
are O
attentive O
, O
and O
have O
smiles O
on O
their O
faces O

Even O
the O
pasta B-A
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
). O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-A
, O
there O
weren O
' O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings B-A
in O
the O
appetizer B-A
section O
. O

Maybe O
I O
say O
so O
because O
it O
looked O
promising O
for O
people O
who O
like O
artery O
- O
clogging O
jewish B-A
deli I-A
food I-A
, O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
poorly O
run O
and O
awful O
. O

After O
my O
3rd O
time O
the O
manager B-A
remembered O
me O
and O
treated O
me O
like O
an O
usual O
customer O
. O

This O
place O
is O
greatly O
welcome O
in O
the O
desolate O
little O
strip O
between O
the O
Prospect O
Expressway O
and O
Greenwood O
Cemetery O
- O
a O
wasteland O
we O
like O
to O
call O
The O
Sliv O
. O

now O
if O
they O
could O
only O
get O
a O
toaster B-A
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

When O
he O
' O
s O
not O
making O
authentic O
Neapolitan B-A
pizza I-A
in O
the O
open O
brick O
oven O
or O
lightly O
frying O
zucchini B-A

, O
he O
' O
s O
visiting O
the O
regulars O
( O
a O
growing O
legion O
) O
and O
checking O
on O
newcomers O
. O

Wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-A
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

The O
ingredients B-A
taste O
fresher O
, O
the O
crust B-A
is O
thinner O
and O
crispier O
, O
the O
slice B-A
is O
less O
oily O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
never O
burnt O
like O
it O
occasionally O
is O
at O
Joe O
' O
s O
. O

Fish B-A
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

The O
prices B-A
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-A
and O
food B-A
. O

Go O
only O
if O
you O
are O
already O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
bother O
going O
farther O
for O
a O
better O
place O
. O

Top O
spot O
in O
town O
for O
Vietnamese B-A
classics I-A
, O
better O
than O
places O
that O
cost O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

less O
wait B-A
time I-A
for O
me O
! O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
really O
blah O
, O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O
. O

Having O
discovered O
Ping O
' O
s O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
we O
entered O
with O
qualms O
but O
were O
instantly O
put O
to O
ease O
by O
the O
fish B-A
tanks I-A
that O
greet O
you O
as O
u O
walk O
in O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red O
Eye O
Grill O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
owner B-A
' O
s O
first O
venture O
and O
it O
shows O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-A
in O
Fornino O
' O
s O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-A
and O
noodle B-A
soup I-A
dishes I-A
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu B-A
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-A
cheeses I-A
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-A
are O
great O
. O

The O
lobster B-A
sandwich I-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-A
with I-A
Scallops I-A
and I-A
Shrimp I-A
is O
great O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
authentic O
. O

The O
dim B-A
sum I-A
is O
delectable O
while O
the O
prices B-A
are O
quite O
easy O
on O
the O
wallet O
. O

I O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish B-A
of O
spinach B-A
ravioli I-A
in I-A
a I-A
light I-A
oil I-A
and I-A
garlic I-A
sauce I-A
, O
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
NYC O
Italian O
joints O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
similar O
dish B-A
replaceendes I-A
at I-A
. I-A

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-A
food I-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
encountered O
. O

A O
million O
better O
places O
to O
go O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
' O
ll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Okay O
- O
i O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
Chicken B-A
Teriyaki I-A
dish I-A
and O
found O
that O
the O
chicken B-A
was O
extremely O
dry O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
. O

We O
had O
reservations B-A
at O
9pm O
, O
but O
was O
not O
seated O
until O
10 O
: O
15pm O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-A
' I-A
s I-A
special I-A
fried I-A
fish I-A
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-A
! O

Three O
strikes O
and O
this O
restaurant O
is O
out O
. O

We O
bring O
in O
a O
party O
of O
ten O
or O
so O
every O
week O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-A
England I-A
Chowder I-A
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-A
Bisque I-A
. O

So O
, O
a O
little O
inconsistency O
there O
but O
either O
way O
, O
both O
pizzas B-A
were O
really O
good O
. O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi B-A
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

We O
would O
return O
to O
this O
place O
again O
! O

Not O
enough O
wines B-A
by I-A
the I-A
glass I-A
either O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-A
breast I-A
special I-A
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

I O
must O
say O
it O
' O
s O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food B-A
because O
it O
was O
not O
as O
spectacular O
as O
the O
view O
. O

These O
innovators O
of O
french B-A
indian I-A
fusion I-A
do O
a O
great O
job O
of O
making O
dishes B-A
as O
interesting O
as O
possible O
while O
still O
being O
accessible O
. O

Just O
don O
' O
t O
take O
the O
seat B-A
between O
the O
bar B-A
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O
. O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
-- O
the O
food B-A
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-A
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-A
shrimp I-A
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
eater O
. O

One O
should O
not O
go O
to O
Lucky O
Strike O
for O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
awful O
-- O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
( O
and O
I O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
) O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table B-A
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
. O

We O
could O
only O
get O
through O
an O
appetizer B-A
and O
cheese B-A
fondue I-A
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

Both O
times O
we O
waited O
well O
over O
a O
half O
hour O
for O
a O
table B-A
( O
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B-A
). O

happy O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
at O
this O
place O
and O
would O
warmly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
and O
have O
found O
them O
to O
be O
the O
most O
excellent O
of O
the O
Indian O
eateries O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

night O
without O
a O
reservation B-A
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait B-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
but O
the O
manager B-A
was O
so O
nice O
and O
made O
our O
wait B-A
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Try O
the O
green B-A
curry I-A
!!! O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-A
as O
an O
appetizer B-A
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
wonderful O
. O

We O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation B-A
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
. O

You O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
seat B-A
and O
the O
currys B-A
( I-A
masaman I-A
, I-A
green I-A
, I-A
red I-A
) I-A
are O
full O
of O
flavor B-A
and O
come O
super O
spicy O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

The O
food B-A
there O
are O
sastifying O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
try O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner B-A
and O
drinks B-A
! O

The O
bar B-A
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-A
and O
well O
priced B-A
wines B-A
. O

I O
agree O
. O

Last O
memorial O
day O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B-A
but O
was O
told O
they O
were O
closed O
that O
weekend O
( O
interesting O
, O
but O
...). O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
. O

Great O
wine B-A
selection I-A
, O
Gigondas B-A
is O
worth O
the O
price B-A
, O
and O
the O
house B-A
champagne I-A
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

at O
night O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
hard O
to O
hear O
your O
own O
conversation O
with O
everyone O
else O
competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
- O
the O
music B-A
playing O
in O
the O
background O
is O
also O
voluminous O
. O

It O
just O
wasn O
' O
t O
Thai O
. O

I O
have O
enjoyed O
everything O
I O
have O
ever O
gotten O
and O
the O
fish B-A
is O
so O
fresh O
and O
always O
prepared O
in O
a O
great O
way O
. O

I O
particularly O
love O
their O
yellowfun B-A
tuna I-A
and O
their O
mussel B-A
selection I-A
. O

I O
love O
to O
visit O
Murrays O
for O
my O
bagel B-A
fix O
. O

We O
made O
early O
dinner B-A
reservations I-A
and O
were O
thoroughly O
impressed O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
grandfather O
, O
its O
old O
school O
Italian O
scenery B-A
with O
lots O
of O
fun O
stuff O
to O
admire O
. O

Recommended O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

Cheese B-A
plate I-A
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

I O
could O
have O
drank O
4 O
glasses B-A
of I-A
water I-A
and O
still O
been O
parched O
- O
so O
watch O
out O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-A
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-A
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

I O
think O
locals O
rate O
this O
place O
so O
high O
. O

Service B-A
is O
average O
. O

But O
they O
' O
ve O
done O
a O
really O
nice O
job O
of O
offering O
all O
the O
typical O
pizzeria O
faves O
plus O
some O
terrific O
specials B-A
like O
the O
Godmother B-A
pizza I-A
( I-A
a I-A
sort I-A
of I-A
traditional I-A
flat I-A
pizza I-A
with I-A
an I-A
olive I-A
oil I-A
- I-A
brushed I-A
crust I-A
and I-A
less I-A
tomato I-A
sauce I-A
than I-A
usual I-A
) I-A
. O

Go O
girls O
!!! O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich B-A
, O
didn O
' O
t O
include O
plastic B-A
forks I-A
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
include O
pita B-A
with O
the O
hummus B-A
platter I-A
. O

The O
steak B-A
is O
good O
, O
the O
fish B-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
sushi B-A
was O
surprisingly O
great O
. O

For O
asian O
fusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
places O
further O
downtown O
. O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-A
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff B-A
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

This O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
my O
new O
favorite O
places O
. O

For O
being O
number O
1 O
, O
this O
place O
has O
alot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
order O
to O
truly O
earn O
its O
so O
called O
reputation O
. O

For O
myself O
and O
family O
we O
would O
only O
go O
here O
to O
celebrate O
an O
occassion O
, O
I O
do O
prefer O
smaller O
, O
quiter O
restaurants O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

They O
all O
know O
you O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
still O
choose O
to O
eat O
there O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
diverse O
cocktails B-A
, O
the O
chill O
decor B-A
, O
and O
the O
decent O
sushi B-A
. O

We O
ended O
the O
dinner B-A
with O
a O
surprisingly O
light O
and O
flaky O
apple B-A
tarte I-A
tatin I-A
. O

The O
buffet B-A
had O
a O
nice O
selection B-A
. O

Waitstaff B-A
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
such O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette O
, O
you O
' O
re O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
several O
times O
and O
am O
totally O
smitten O
. O

Terrible O
experience O
. O

I O
love O
the O
place O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food B-A
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
try O
the O
chocolate B-A
! O

It O
' O
s O
only O
$ O
1 O
. O
95 O
for O
a O
regular O
slice O
and O
$ O
4 O
. O
00 O
for O
a O
slice O
with O
a O
mushroom O
, O
not O
mushrooms O
. O

There O
is O
a O
real O
gallery O
of O
stars O
that O
have O
visited O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
below O
average O
, O
the O
service B-A
was O
pathetic O
, O
there O
was O
no O
ambience B-A
at O
all O
. O

I O
REALLY O
ENJOYED O
THE O
SHOWS B-A
PUT O
ON O
BY O
THE O
ACTORS B-A
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New B-A
York I-A
Bagel I-A
. O

service B-A
was O
efficient O
courteous O
. O

this O
one O
is O
definintely O
my O
least O
favorite O
. O

I O
have O
been O
urged O
by O
friends O
for O
months O
to O
check O
out O
the O
mermaid O
inn O
. O

The O
miso B-A
soup I-A
lacked O
flavor B-A
and O
the O
fish B-A
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Everytime O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
go O
there O
, O
we O
are O
never O
disappointed O
. O

They O
are O
the O
best O
bagels B-A
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

We O
were O
not O
disappointed O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
read O
some O
of O
the O
previews O
reviews O
- O
people O
are O
either O
not O
New O
Yorkers O
or O
have O
more O
appreciation O
for O
ambience B-A
then O
food B-A
. O

Toons O
has O
recently O
been O
redone O
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space B-A
. O

$ O
160 O
for O
2 O
filets B-A
, O
2 O
sides B-A
, O
an O
appetizer B-A
and O
drinks B-A
. O

While O
the O
prices B-A
are O
nothing O
special O
, O
the O
portions B-A
are O
huge O
. O

Its O
a O
nice O
quiet O
location B-A
to O
go O
eat O
a O
good O
meal B-A
, O
relax O
, O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
and O
have O
a O
very O
good O
time O
. O

We O
arrived O
for O
dinner B-A
expecting O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
a O
place O
that O
has O
an O
impressive O
past O
- O
but O
, O
that O
' O
s O
just O
it O
-- O
the O
PAST O
! O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place O
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot B-A
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
Prix B-A
Fixe I-A
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
per O
person O
, O
but O
it O
is O
Well O
worth O
itsuperb O
food B-A
. O

Rao O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
nothing O
special O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

We O
had O
the O
most O
wonderful O
waitress B-A
. O

While O
the O
staff B-A
at O
this O
little O
bistro O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
I O
have O
never O
experienced O
more O
incompetency O
. O

The O
quail B-A
was O
fantastic O
and O
unique O
and O
the O
pastas B-A
were O
full O
of O
flavor B-A
. O

When O
we O
left O
at O
8 O
: O
00 O
PM O
, O
it O
was O
packed O
and O
noisy O
. O

Okay O
, O
so O
I O
never O
write O
but O
there O
doesn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
fair O
balance O
of O
positive O
to O
negative O
reviews O
concerning O
Green O
Bo O
and O
it O
' O
s O
time O
to O
speak O
up O
- O
I O
live O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

The O
zucchini B-A
and O
mashed B-A
potatoes I-A
are O
a O
blend O
of O
garlic B-A
and O
butter B-A
which O
simply O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
courteous O
and O
friendly O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

Decor B-A
is O
nice O
though O
service B-A
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
rushed O
service B-A
, O
we O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
drinks B-A
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-A
Scallop I-A
roll I-A
.. O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
fine O
Indian B-A
dining I-A
experience I-A
that O
is O
definitely O
a O
value O
for O
your O
dollar O
. O

And O
even O
with O
it O
' O
s O
Pub B-A
atmosphere I-A
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

This O
big O
draw O
is O
the O
all O
you O
can O
sushi B-A
here O
for O
$ O
19 O
. O
95 O
! O

I O
consider O
the O
best O
Grand O
Sichuan O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
. O

we O
spent O
50 O
$$ O
definetly O
will O
come O
back O
with O
my O
friends O
!!! O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
workers B-A
ignore O
me O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
female O
customers O
, O
other O
times O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
skipped O
my O
order B-A
. O

The O
specials B-A
are O
usually O
quite O
good O
too O
. O

They O
' O
ve O
the O
best O
desserts B-A
and O
mixed B-A
drinks I-A
as O
well O
as O
snack B-A
foods I-A
. O

Try O
the O
chocolate B-A
mud I-A
cake I-A
( I-A
warmed I-A
) I-A
with O
2 O
scoops O
of O
dulce B-A
de I-A
leche I-A
gelato I-A
. O

That O
' O
s O
good O
and O
bad O
. O

Really O
cool O
stauff B-A
inside O
. O

While O
the O
new O
restaurant O
still O
features O
much O
of O
the O
same O
classical B-A
furniture I-A
that O
made O
Tiffin O
so O
attractive O
, O
the O
menu B-A
has O
been O
overhauled O
. O

The O
best O
burger B-A
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
Village O
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu B-A
. O

I O
would O
have O
gotten O
some O
cole B-A
slaw I-A
and O
a O
knish B-A
if O
my O
stomach O
had O
more O
space O
. O

came O
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
save O
much O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
great O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O
. O

Three O
of O
us O
arrived O
for O
dinner B-A
about O
5 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
week O
night O
without O
reservations B-A
. O

The O
blond B-A
wood I-A
decor I-A
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium O
sake B-A
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
great O
. O

There O
is O
usually O
a O
wait B-A
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Be O
careful O
, O
when O
they O
say O
spicy O
, O
they O
mean O
it O
! O

Your O
money B-A
could O
easily O
be O
better O
spent O
elsewhere O
( O
Anywhere O
). O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won O
' O
t O
toast O
your O
replacestart B-A
bagel I-A
replaceend O
, O
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
make O
eggs B-A
for O
the O
replacestart B-A
bagel I-A
replaceend O
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Bring O
your O
appetites O
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she O
' O
s O
- O
way O
- O
cuter O
- O
than O
- O
me O
- O
that O
- O
b O
@#$* O
way O
). O

Of O
course O
this O
atmosphere B-A
is O
lacking O
, O
but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
24 O
hour O
bagel B-A
place O
anyways O
? O

Service B-A
was O
very O
good O
and O
warm O
. O

For O
dinner B-A
I O
had O
the O
chicken B-A
tikka I-A
- I-A

Cornelia O
Street O
looks O
like O
a O
Broadway O
set O
for O
West O
Side O
Story O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
Po O
is O
so O
cool O
quaint O
you O
really O
can O
' O
t O
top O
the O
setting B-A
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-A
in O
NYC O
. O

Like O
others O
have O
said O
, O
don O
' O
t O
expect O
the O
restaurant O
to O
make O
a O
nite O
out O
romantic O
for O
you O
and O
yes O
, O
a O
busy O
restaurant O
may O
require O
you O
to O
wait O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place O
kicks O
ass O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-A
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
nothing O
like O
its O
menu B-A
description I-A
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-A
Se I-A
- I-A
Ew I-A
or O
Chicken B-A
with I-A
Cashew I-A
Nuts I-A
for O
a O
memorable O
and O
repeatable O
experience O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
O O
. O
K O
. O
pizza B-A
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
well O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

THE O
BEST O
PLACE O
TO O
BRING O
KIDS O
OR O
ANY O
FRIENDS O
WHO O
WANT O
TO O
DO O
SOMETHING O
DIFFERENT O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
extraordinary O
hype O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant O
. O

I O
will O
be O
returning O
. O

Leon O
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B-A
bistro I-A
fare I-A
, O
good O
specials B-A
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Heartland O
Breweries O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu B-A
- I-A
Shabu I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

Food B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
appear O
to O
be O
cooked O
on O
premisis O
but O
there O
' O
s O
a O
high O
turnover O
so O
its O
pretty O
fresh O
. O

Restaurant O
was O
dirty O
and O
unkempt O
. O

Nice O
place O
though O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu O
! O

Similar O
to O
other O
Indian O
restaurants O
, O
they O
use O
the O
dinner B-A
special I-A
to O
attract O
customers O
at O
the O
door O
. O

It O
is O
a O
small O
restuarant O
so O
go O
early O
and O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
and O
quiet O
- O
go O
late O
and O
it O
will O
be O
packed O
! O

The O
people O
with O
carts O
of O
food B-A
don O
' O
t O
understand O
you O
because O
they O
don O
' O
t O
speak O
English O
, O
their O
job O
is O
to O
give O
you O
the O
delicious O
food B-A
you O
point O
at O
. O

The O
crackling B-A
calamari I-A
salad I-A
, O
which O
is O
usually O
a O
cheap O
disaster O
at O
many O
restaurants O
, O
is O
crispy O
and O
lightly O
dressed O
. O

Not O
the O
greatest O
sushi B-A
place I-A
, O
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
$ O
19 O
. O
95 O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
. O

Shockingly O
easy O
to O
throw O
a O
group B-A
dinner I-A
here O
: O
simple O
contract O
, O
deposit O
only O
to O
hold O
the O
date O
the O
entire O
2nd O
fl O
mezz O
for O
our O
grp O
of O
20 O
. O

The O
Thai B-A
ice I-A
tea I-A
was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O
! O

We O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
staff B-A
but O
maybe O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
lucky O
? O

Drinks B-A
way O
over O
priced B-A
. O

The O
main O
downside O
to O
the O
place O
is O
the O
nazi O
- O
like O
guy B-A
running O
it O
who O
constantly O
complains O
about O
the O
noise B-A
level I-A
. O

What O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
was O
how O
the O
food B-A
came O
right O
after O
it O
was O
ordered O
. O

But O
WARNING O
: O
to O
all O
those O
that O
use O
this O
site O
be O
weary O
, O
be O
very O
weary O
of O
recommendations O
. O

Moderate O
prices B-A
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
hyde O
Pub O
last O
night O
. O

Try O
it O
side O
by O
side O
and O
there O
' O
s O
no O
comparison O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-A
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

My O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un O
- O
tasty O
food B-A
although O
presented O
well O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

So O
sorry O
I O
can O
' O
t O
rate O
this O
better O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-A
is O
excellent O
. O

Buon O
appetito O
! O

Great O
roofdeck B-A
, O
nice O
group O
of O
30 O
somethings O
, O
but O
no O
music B-A
, O
kind O
of O
quiet O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
knowing O
that O
the O
manager B-A
( O
a O
bubbly O
, O
friendly O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
) O
truly O
cared O
about O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
. O

Ok O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
Village O
of O
NYC O
, O
we O
have O
spoiled O
by O
a O
plethora O
of O
restaurants O
, O
most O
of O
which O
stay O
open O
very O
late O
. O

However O
, O
service B-A
was O
as O
plain O
as O
sesame B-A
crusted I-A
Salmon I-A
I O
had O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
' O
s O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch B-A
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-A
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
. O

So O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
accurate O
about O
the O
crowd B-A
and O
noise B-A
. O

You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
with O
that O
logic O
in O
mind O
, O
Spice O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
grab O
some O
cheap O
eats B-A
and O
drinks B-A
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-A
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
all O
the O
raving O
I O
went O
to O
check O
it O
out O
with O
one O
of O
my O
enthusiastic O
friends O
this O
last O
Saturday O
night O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
its O
all O
its O
cracked O
up O
to O
be O
. O

Place O
should O
also O
have O
a O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
3 O
chili O
rating O
to O
be O
more O
authentic O
... O

The O
service B-A
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served B-A
. O

Went O
last O
Thursday O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
more O
and O
more O
everytime O
i O
go O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place O
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

Other O
than O
being O
a O
little O
crowded O
and O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-A
is O
filled O
with O
energy O
( O
and O
the O
beautiful O
people B-A
of O
course O
) O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
surprising O
good O
! O

We O
only O
ordered O
desserts B-A
and O
drinks B-A
, O
but O
no O
refills O
were O
offered O
. O

Saul O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Waiters B-A
are O
slow O
but O
sweet O
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B-A
, O
once O
for O
brunch B-A
and O
twice O
for O
lunch B-A
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

the O
real O
kicker O
of O
the O
menu B-A
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
beef B-A
cubes I-A
or O
the O
chicken B-A
with I-A
chili I-A
and I-A
lemon I-A
grass I-A
. O

It O
was O
good O
, O
but O
was O
not O
what O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O

The O
music B-A
is O
the O
best O
among O
all O
the O
Indian O
restaurants O
I O
have O
visited O
. O

The O
bread B-A
and O
lamb B-A
chops I-A
I O
had O
before O
the O
meal B-A
were O
quite O
good O
, O
however O
. O

He O
always O
says O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
customers O
. O

Rao O
' O
s O
has O
the O
best O
service B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
in O
NYC O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer B-A
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles B-A
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar B-A
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes B-A
on O
the O
table O
. O

one O
of O
the O
best O
Chicken B-A
Tikka I-A
Masala I-A
. O

Excellent O
dumplings B-A
served O
amid O
clean O
, O
chic O
decor B-A
. O

The O
kitchen B-A
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

The O
corned B-A
beef I-A
and O
pastrami B-A
are O
excellent O
, O
much O
less O
fatty O
than O
those O
big O
tourist O
places O
around O
Times O
Square O
. O

Cute O
place B-A

but O
would O
never O

again O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
hostess B-A
called O
me O
today O
to O
thank O
us O
for O
coming O
and O
mentioned O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
my O
girlfriend O
enjoyed O
her O
birthday O
- O
unexpected O
, O
but O
a O
truly O
above O
and O
beyond O
thing O
to O
do O
... O

people B-A
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
it O
' O
s O
new O
york O
! O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
plain B-A
slice I-A
is O
great O
and O
if O
you O
get O
toppings B-A
, O
the O
whole O
slice O
is O
topped O
with O
them O
, O
not O
sparsely O
sprinkled O
on O
like O
some O
places O
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Service B-A
is O
great O
, O
takeout B-A
is O
good O
too O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
on O
here O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overwhelmed O
after O
the O
7 O
PM O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

Everything O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
menu B-A
is O
quite O
extensive O
, O
and O
you O
eat O
with O
a O
view B-A
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
city O
. O

You O
' O
ll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don O
' O
t O
compare O
. O

For O
the O
quality B-A
of I-A
food I-A
, O
a O
little O
too O
expensive O
. O

Came O
looking O
for O
this O
place O
because O
I O
heard O
good O
things O
. O

I O
live O
on O
the O
street O
this O
place O
is O
on O
. O

Horrible O
. O

Here O
' O
s O
to O
the O
fake O
fish B-A
tanks I-A
too O
... O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait B-A
though O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
bad O
service B-A
and O
the O
fish B-A
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-A
jazz I-A
band I-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B-A
Cobb I-A
Salad I-A
. O

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B-A
room I-A
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O
. O

What O
an O
amazing O
meal B-A
and O
experience O
! O

Unique O
apppetizers B-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
always O
been O
amazed O
at O
how O
they O
' O
ve O
handled O
all O
the O
various O
different O
group O
sizes O
that O
come O
in O
. O

IT O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
town O
for O
a O
Monday O
night O
dinner B-A
at O
a O
fine O
restaurant O
. O

Nothing O
special O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-A
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn O
' O
t O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips B-A
or O
a O
side B-A
. O

and O
never O
strayed O
. O

The O
wait B-A
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim B-A
sum I-A
, O
but O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
sharing O
tables B-A
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B-A
sum I-A
atmosphere O
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

Leave O
the O
kids O
at O
home O
! O

This O
place O
has O
good O
potential O
, O
but O
needs O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O
spending O
that O
much O
money B-A
on O
indian B-A
food I-A
you O
can O
get O
everywhere O
else O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-A
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

And O
all O
of O
that O
won O
' O
t O
break O
your O
bank O
! O

The O
Thai B-A
food I-A
is O
good O
. O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

Great O
selection B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
, O
and O
seafood B-A
. O

delicious O
. O

Acceptable O
prices B-A
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

we O
were O
seated O
at O
the O
sushi B-A
bar I-A
in O
front O
of O
yasuda O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

As O
I O
made O
the O
title O
, O
it O
' O
s O
an O
affordable O
restaurant O
for O
great O
taste B-A
. O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-A
! O

Orsay O
, O
is O
a O
very O
pleasnt O
throw O
back O
to O
traditional O
French B-A
food I-A
, O
and O
French O
service B-A
as O
well O
. O

It O
' O
s O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
table B-A
for O
a O
large O
group O
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
get O
hustled O
out O
. O

Great O
food B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices B-A
. O

Salads B-A
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B-A
. O

I O
ordered O
tamarind B-A
duck I-A
and O
my O
wife O
ordered O
noodles B-A
with I-A
ground I-A
beef I-A
, O
and O
we O
were O
both O
delighted O
by O
the O
way O
the O
dishes B-A
evoked O
Thai B-A
flavors I-A
in O
unexpected O
ways O
. O

That O
' O
s O
why O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
for O
that O
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-A
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
. O

They O
' O
re O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

The O
prices B-A
are O
about O
$ O
9 O
for O
an O
entree B-A
for O
dinner B-A
and O
even O
less O
for O
lunch B-A
. O

and O
you O
can O
' O
t O
beat O
the O
prices B-A
. O

but O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
wanna O
live O
there O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka O

Should O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
the O
cuisine B-A
definitely O
try O
it O
. O

I O
had O
the O
black B-A
cod I-A
with I-A
yuzu I-A
sauce I-A
, O
which O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Prices B-A
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant O
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
choices O
for O
me O
to O
go O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

This O
quiet O
dark O
asian O
bistro O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

I O
knew O
upon O
visiting O
NYC O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
an O
orginal O
deli O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
! O

Total O
hipster O
- O
wannabe O
attitude O
in O
an O
otherwise O
sweet O
spot B-A
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
might O
be O
a O
wait B-A
if O
you O
have O
no O

Thank O

First O
of O
all O
Dal O
Bukhara O

Everything O

from O
the O
soft O
bread B-A
, O
soggy O
salad B-A
, O
and O
50 O
minute O
wait B-A
time O
, O
with O
an O
incredibly O
rude O
service B-A
to O
deliver O
below O
average O
food B-A
. O

- O
i O
asked O
for O
them O
spicy O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
). O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

The O
sicilian B-A
is O
my O
favorite O
it O
is O
moist O
not O
dry O
like O
most O
places O
but O
all O
their O
pizza B-A
is O
great O
! O

Downstairs B-A
lounge I-A
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

The O
menu B-A
prices I-A
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality B-A
and O
portion B-A
size I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

( O
food B-A
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
busboy B-A
, O
not O
waiter B-A
) O
We O
got O
no O
cheese B-A
offered O
for O
the O
pasta B-A
, O
our O
water B-A
and I-A
replacestart I-A
wine I-A
glasses O
replaceend O
remained O
EMPTY O
our O
entire O
meal B-A
, O
when O
we O
would O
have O
easily O
spent O
another O
$ O
20 O
on O
wine B-A
. O

The O
takeout B-A
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-A
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

Off O
the O
beaten O
path O
, O
this O
jewel O
of O
a O
restaurant O
shines O
just O
one O
block O
away O
from O
the O
plethora O
of O
6th O
street O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

Could O
be O
pricey O
without O
a O
prix B-A
fixe I-A
meal I-A
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
an O
excellent O
date O
spot B-A
because O
of O
the O
ambiance B-A
and O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
night B-A
scene I-A
is O
more O
than O
alive O
. O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-A
- O
that O
' O
s O
it O
. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
waitress B-A
was O
awesome O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-A
and O
actors B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B-A
sauce I-A
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
just O
OK O
, O
I O
would O
never O
go O
back O
. O

Zero O
ambiance B-A
to O
boot O
. O

Got O
a O
little O
loud O
after O
8pm O
when O
the O
joint O
got O
full O
. O

Scalina O
Fedeli O
reminded O
me O
why O
service B-A
is O
so O
integral O
to O
fine O
dining B-A
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
thai B-A
popcorn I-A
:) O

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
for O
the O
nex O
time O
. O

Everything O
looks O
great O
, O
the O
drinks B-A
, O
the O
decor B-A
, O
the O
food B-A
, O
even O
the O
people O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
my O
father O
lifted O
his O
pen O
from O
the O
check B-A
a O
chef B-A
appeared O
to O
usher O
us O
out O
. O

The O
parathas B-A
and O
kebabs B-A
are O
made O
when O
ordered O
ensuring O
a O
level O
of O
freshness O
that O
is O
unsurpassed O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint O
. O

The O
tuna B-A
and O
wasabe B-A
potatoes I-A
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
replacestart B-A
coat I-A
check I-A
girls I-A
replaceend O
who O
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
know O
what O
a O

is O
on O
a O
realtively O
non O
- O
busy O
night O
( O
for O
the O
replacestart B-A
coat I-A
check I-A

). O

My O
fiance O
took O
me O
to O
Scopa O
last O
week O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
believe O
the O
food B-A
. O

Ummm O
... O
the O
beer B-A
was O
cold O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT O
' O
s O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
and O
can O
get O
a O
little O
warm O
, O
but O
hello O
, O
it O
' O
s O
NYC O
! O

We O
had O
great O
desserts B-A
( O
including O
the O
best O
cannoli B-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
) O
and O
then O
they O
offered O
an O
after B-A
dinner I-A
drink I-A
, O
on O
the O
house O
. O

Good O
crowd O
, O
good O
outdoor B-A
seating I-A
, O
with O
a O
hip O
japanese O
vibe B-A
. O

Even O
with O
the O
prix B-A
fixe I-A
pricing I-A
, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

We O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
( O
which O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
), O
and O
then O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
high O
traffic O
area B-A
in O
the O
back O
, O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
room B-A
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

Good O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
the O
owners B-A
have O
some O
imagination O
and O
they O
have O
actually O
pulled O
it O
off O
, O
like O
in O
this O
case O
. O

However O
, O
their O
popularity O
has O
yet O
to O
slow O
down O
, O
and O
I O
still O
find O
myself O
drawn O
to O
their O
ambiance B-A
and O
delectable O
reputation O
. O

Where O
replacestart B-A
tanks I-A
replaceend O
in O
other O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
display O
a O
lurking O
myriad O
of O
sad O
- O
looking O
marine O
life O
in O
their O
murky O
waters O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
tanks I-A
replaceend O
at O
Ping O
' O
s O
are O
clear O
as O
glass O
with O
healthy O
- O
looking O
creatures O
who O
do O
not O
yet O
know O
that O
they O
will O
be O
part O
of O
some O
dim B-A
sum I-A
lover O
' O
s O
brunch B-A
. O

The O
Halibut B-A
was O
too O
salty O
, O
dessert B-A
was O
so O
so O
( O
don O
' O
t O
waste O
any O
of O
your O
calories O
) O
and O
service B-A
was O
poor O
. O

The O
view B-A
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
great O
. O

The O
place B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
too O
hard O
to O
find O
, O
but O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
packed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
got O
our O
food B-A
, O
the O
line O
reached O
the O
door O
. O

Good O
bagels B-A
and O
good O
cream B-A
cheese I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced B-A
. O

Always O
great O
service B-A
! O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-A
was O
awsome O
. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
many O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
and O
Roth O
' O
s O
Steakhouse O
has O
quickly O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
replacestart B-A
chicken I-A
casserole O
replaceend O
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-A
, O
all O
dark O
meat B-A
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

A O
bit O
breezy O
up O
there O
on O
the O
mezzanine B-A
from O
the O
wind O
coming O
from O
the O
tracks O
. O

I O
went O
to O
DF O
for O
Valentines B-A
Day I-A
dinner I-A
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-A
fish I-A
, O
drunken B-A
chicken I-A
and O
the O
soupy B-A
dumplings I-A
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-A
fry I-A
blue I-A
crab I-A
. O

I O
LOVED O
THE O
SHOWS B-A
. O

and O
i O
have O
been O
around O
the O
block O
, O
to O
say O
the O
very O
least O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal B-A
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-A
from O
the O
dumpling B-A
menu I-A
. O

The O
rereplacestart O

aesthetics O
rereplacestart O
place O

of O
this O
place B-A
are O
like O
an O
airport O
lounge O
. O

Then O
, O
get O
ripped O
on O
free O
box B-A
wine I-A
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-A
. O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-A
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-A
and O
a O
sushi B-A
chef I-A
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

The O
food B-A
itself O
was O
just O
ok O
- O
nothing O
spectacular O
- O
but O
the O
service B-A
was O
awful O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-A
. O

As O
there O
were O
so O
many O
to O
choose O
from O
we O
wandered O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
looking O
in O
the O
windows O
and O
such O
noticicing O
many O
empty O
seats B-A
, O
except O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O
. O

Also O
, O
don O
' O
t O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll B-A
, O
if O
it O
' O
s O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
have O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

... O
and O
that O
' O
s O
saying O
a O
lot O
. O

those O
rolls B-A
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
fresh O
. O

The O
pesto B-A
pizza I-A
was O
excellent O
, O
thin B-A
- I-A
crust I-A
pizza I-A
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy O
Italian B-A
cheese I-A
that O
I O
' O
d O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
could O
get O
attention O
from O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
two O
cats O
running O
around O
that O
kept O
batting O
at O
my O
table O
. O

if O
your O
into O
thai O
.. O
you O
cannot O
miss O
this O
great O
restaurant O
. O

Going O
to O
Ballato O
' O
s O
is O
like O
coming O
home O
and O
eating O
in O
my O
own O
kitchen O
, O
an O
absolute O
delight O
! O

try O
the O
spicy O
shrimp B-A
appetizer I-A
( O
again O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
value O
in O
the O
world O
but O
worth O
the O
price B-A
) O
and O
the O
lamb B-A
vindaloo I-A
is O
great O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-A
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
more O
underrated O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

for O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
who O
will O
get O
a O
big O
thrill O
out O
of O
the O
location O
! O

Everyone O
that O
has O
ever O
come O
here O
with O
me O
has O
become O
a O
convert O
and O
returned O
regularly O
with O
their O
own O
friends O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-A
or O
another O
visit O

I O
go O
at O
least O
3 O
times O
a O
month O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

I O
think O
the O
restaurant O
was O
too O
loud O
( O
when O
full O
) O
to O
be O
romantic O
. O

I O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B-A
here O
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
been O
perfect O
- O
on O
a O
date O
with O
my O
husband O
, O
with O
my O
mom O
, O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
larger O
groups O
. O

When O
you O
want O
a O
piece O
of O
beef B-A
, O
head O
on O
over O
. O

Delicate O
spices B-A
, O
onions B-A
, O
eggs B-A
and O
a O
kick O
- O
ass O
roti B-A
. O

Incredible O
food B-A
at O
a O
very O
agreable O
price B-A
brings O
me O
back O
just O
about O
every O
other O
day O
to O
this O
authentic O
Thai O
restaurant O
. O

I O
actually O
gave O
Patroon O
another O
chance O
before O
writing O
this O
, O
but O
the O
second O
visit O
was O
even O
worse O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
certain O
table B-A
, O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
! O

Unbelievable O
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
living O
in O
the O
Columbia O
University O
area O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
with O
3 O
kids O
- O
now O
in O
their O
teens O
. O

The O
menu B-A
has O
lots O
of O
options O
: O
I O
hope O
to O
go O
back O
to O
try O
those O
potato B-A
pancakes I-A
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
wake O
up O
on O
a O
saturday O
or O
sunday O
it O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
on O
my O
mind O
is O
when O
and O
how O
I O
will O
be O
getting O
to O
fried B-A
dumpling I-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
isn O
' O
t O
the O
friendliest O
or O
most O
competent O
, O
and O
I O
am O
stickler O
for O
service B-A
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
place O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi B-A
and O
one O
secondi B-A
and O
split O
them O
, O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B-A
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
overheard O
comments O
from O
him O
to O
his O
employees B-A
that O
should O
not O
have O
been O
delivered O
in O
the O
dining B-A
area I-A
and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
sitting O
there O
while O
he O
lectured O
another O
customer O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-A
cakes I-A
too O
. O

Now O
at O
the O
top O
of O
our O
list O
, O
Del O
Frisco O
' O
s O
Steakhouse O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
dining B-A
experience I-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-A
and O
the O
great O
staff B-A
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Just O
bring O
someone O
who O
speaks O
Cantonese O
because O
waiter B-A
may O
not O
understand O
you O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

Not O
someplace O
I O
would O
seek O
to O
try O
out O
but O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
area O
again O
, O
I O
will O
certainly O
stop O
by O
. O

The O
bruschetta B-A
and O
panini B-A
' O
s O
are O
so O
yummy O
! O

Food B-A
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

Every O
waitress B-A
and O
customer O
who O
passed O
by O
me O
bumped O
into O
my O
chair O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can O
' O
t O
get O
enough O
. O

Always O
popular O
, O
always O
full O
, O
always O
a O
wait B-A
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
miss O
it O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

It O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
Sichuan B-A
chef I-A
who O
started O
the O
chain O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

Get O
the O
feeling O
they O
settled O
into O
a O
groove O
a O
while O
ago O
. O

If O
the O
omakase O
is O
to O
showcase O
technique O
and O
variety O
, O
serving B-A
almost O
40 O
% O
of O
items O
BBQ O
- O
ed O
and O
a O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A
roll I-A
wrapped O
with O
not O
- O
so O
- O
fresh O
nori B-A
seems O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
limp O
performance O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-A
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-A
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-A
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

If O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
appreciates O
the O
same O
things O
but O
hope O
to O
have O
food B-A
to O
spare O
or O
share O
, O
Kai O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
option O
. O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-A
! O

I O
don O
' O
t O
get O
it O
, O
what O
' O
s O
so O
special O
about O
Prune O
? O

I O
' O
d O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
little O
place O
. O

Again O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
- O
by O
all O
means O
, O
come O
here O
. O

The O
first O
2 O
courses B-A
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
chocolate B-A
sampler I-A
was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B-A
wine I-A
far O
too O
sweet O
. O

Butter B-A
was O
melted O
, O
white B-A
wine I-A
warm O
, O
cheese B-A
oozing O
everywhere O
. O

We O
had O
a O
party O
in O
their O
private B-A
room I-A
and O
they O
made O
it O
truly O
memorable O
and O
were O
very O
helpful O
in O
the O
planning O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
walk O
the O
extra O
avenue O
from O
joe O
' O
s O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

It O
cannot O
be O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
ambience O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
, O
because O
the O
place B-A
is O
very O
cramped O
and O
some O
guests O
have O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
aisle B-A
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Shabu O
Tatsu O
at O
least O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
always O
want O
to O
go O
back O
for O
more O
! O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
pre B-A
- I-A
fixe I-A
menu I-A
of O
only O
2 O
choices B-A
per I-A
course I-A
( O
other O
restaurants O
offer O
3 O
choices O
) O
and O
ended O
up O
ordering B-A
a I-A
la I-A
carte I-A
. O

Authentic O
Pakistani B-A
food I-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
, O
and O
the O
chef B-A
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
. O

Get O
it O
together O
. O

The O
eggplant B-A
parmesan I-A
is O
also O
great O
, O
and O
my O
friend O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
Manhattan O
claims O
that O
no O
one O
serves B-A
a O
better O
baked B-A
ziti I-A
with I-A
meatsauce I-A
. O

Quality O
ingredients B-A
preparation O
all O
around O
, O
and O
a O
very O
fair O
price B-A
for O
NYC O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

My O
entree B-A
of O
hot B-A
pot I-A
with I-A
seafood I-A
was O
full O
of O
imitation O
crabmeat B-A
with O
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
shrimp B-A
and O
squid B-A
, O
and O
was O
unnecessarily O
heated O
with O
a O
burner O
. O

We O
began O
with O
the O
cheese B-A
fondue I-A
( O
the O
artisanal O
blend O
) O
and O
added O
apples B-A
and O
kielbasa B-A
to O
dip O
. O

In O
such O
a O
crappy O
part O
of O
town O
to O
find O
a O
good O
value B-A
for O
lunch B-A
, O
this O
place O
is O
great O
. O

Its O
not O
curry B-A
in O
a O
slurry O
crap O
, O
and O
regular O
run O
of O
the O
mill O
food B-A
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while O
leaving O
the O
place O
we O
saw O
two O
people O
looking O
at O
the O
menu B-A
, O
and O
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
help O
telling O
them O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
horrible O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
, O
we O
were O
seated B-A
promptly O
and O
even O
asked O
for O
a O
table B-A
upstairs O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

If O
you O
want O
Americanized O
Chinese B-A
food I-A
with O
your O
usual O
watery O
, O
generic O
white B-A
sauce I-A
, O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
bread I-A
replaceend O
is O
the O
soft O
paratha O
replacestart B-A
bread I-A
replaceend O
( O
unlike O
the O
plain O
replacestart B-A
bread I-A
replaceend O
they O
use O
in O
Calcutta O
), O
and O
the O
stuffing B-A
is O
tandoori B-A
styled O
and O
very O
flavorful O
. O

Service B-A
is O
friendly O
, O
prices B-A
are O
good O
- O
delivery B-A
time I-A
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
for O
the O
way O
this O
pizza B-A
tastes O
, O
I O
' O

willing O

great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
- O
the O
Hoboken O
health O
inspector O
clued O
me O
to O
his O
findings O
that O
this O
is O
THE O
cleanest O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

An O
excellent O
service B-A

The O
food B-A
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-A
noodles I-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
and I-A
chicken I-A
and I-A
coconut I-A
juice I-A
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O
! O

The O
pizza B-A
was O
really O
good O
. O

The O
only O
possible O
drawback O
to O
this O
last O
point O
is O
that O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
this O
posting O
, O
the O
additional O
menu B-A
items I-A
are O
only O
written O
in O
Chinese O
. O

Food B-A
is O
average O
, O
and O
I O
would O
say O
even O
the O
chain O
restaurant O
Baluchi O
' O
s O
tastes O
better O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-A
sizes I-A
are O
appropriate O
. O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

Enjoy O
!!! O

Kosher B-A
dills I-A
are O
the O
perfect O
compliment O
for O
your O
unforgetable O
sandwich B-A
and O
they O
give O
you O
plenty O
of O
them O
. O

Kudos O
to O
Po O
! O

The O
entertainment B-A
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows B-A
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner B-A
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NY O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
Pastis O
was O
a O
place O
that O
came O
recommended O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
nice O
. O

The O
food B-A
there O
is O
so O
good O
that O
even O
to O
order O
out O
the O
wait B-A
is O
incredible O
. O

The O
bartender B-A
on O
my O
most O
recent O
visit O
was O
so O
incredibly O
rude O
that O
I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
. O

Their O
sushi B-A
, O
Kamikaze B-A
and O
other O
Rolls B-A
are O
fresh O
and O
well O
presented O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

It O
' O
s O
true O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
in O
a O
scene O
from O
Goodfellas O
. O

I O
read O
the O
other O
review O
and O
have O
to O
say O
I O
had O
the O
opposite O
experience O
here O
last O
Sunday O
. O

The O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
mayonaisse B-A
for O
my O
side O
of O
fries B-A
I O
received O
from O
one O
of O
the O
food B-A
runners I-A
, O
which O
is O
not O
good O
considering O
the O
bill B-A
was O
nearly O
$ O
100 O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special B-A
, O
the O
braised B-A
lamb I-A
shank I-A
in I-A
red I-A
wine I-A
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

If O
anyones O
has O
doubt O
of O
not O
knowing O
enough O
about O
wines B-A
, O
please O
check O
their O
wine B-A
list I-A
. O

Never O
again O
! O

The O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all O
- O
business O
waitstaff B-A
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food B-A
down O
, O
rushing O
you O
out O
. O

Have O
the O
iced B-A
tea I-A
. O

For O
Park O
avenue O
I O
expected O
so O
much O
more O
. O

Small O
servings B-A
for O
main O
entree B-A
, O
i O
had O
salmon B-A
( O
wasnt O
impressed O
) O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B-A
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

So O
rude O
. O

you O
can O
actually O
get O
2 O
salads B-A
worth O
if O
u O
take O
it O
home O
and O
add O
it O
to O
some O
lettuce B-A
! O

The O

is O
very O
romantic O
and O
definitely O
a O
good O
place B-A
to O
bring O
a O
date O
. O

They O
are O
FAST O
. O

It O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar B-A
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables B-A
and O
the O
waiter B-A
being O
the O
bar B-A
replaceendtender I-A
, I-A
but I-A
we I-A
greatly I-A
enjoyed I-A
the I-A
unobtrusive I-A
replacestart I-A
atmosphere I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
very O
good O
for O
it O
' O
s O
price B-A
, O
better O
than O
most O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

There O
are O
much O
better O
places O
in O
NY O
with O
better O
prices B-A
. O

Very O
neighborhoody O
, O
very O
quick O
and O
sufficient O
. O

Obv B-A
caviar I-A
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B-A
is O
so O
diverse O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
taste O
so O
manydifferent O
varietys O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-A
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

Everything O
is O
delicious O
, O
though O
, O
my O
gf O
and O
I O
come O
here O
once O
a O
week O
sometimes O
- O
you O
will O
get O
addicted O
! O

And O
I O
could O
do O
without O
the O
cigar O
smoke O
. O

Still O
, O
try O
it O
once O
, O
since O
if O
you O
end O
up O
loving O
the O
food B-A
, O
it O
could O
be O
one O
of O
your O
best O
dining B-A
experiences I-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food B-A
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-A
, O
santa B-A
fe I-A
chopped I-A
salad I-A
and O
fish B-A
and I-A
chips I-A
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
very O
calm O
and O
quiet O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-A
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
latter O
since O
you O
won O
' O
t O
go O
for O
seconds O
( O
hint O
hint O
). O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
NY O
, O
maybe O
anywhere O
. O

The O
spicy O
Tuna B-A
roll I-A
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price B-A
range I-A
. O

Price B-A
and O
quality B-A
of O
fish B-A
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

Our O
waiter B-A
and O
all O
of O
the O
people O
helping O
him O
were O
attentive O
and O
genuine O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes B-A
and O
wine B-A
served B-A
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B-A
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort B-A
food I-A
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
ingredients B-A
and O
technique B-A
are O
there O
and O
I O
am O
encouraged O
enough O
to O
return O
at O
lunch B-A
or O
dinner B-A
to O
see O
whether O
the O
boldness O
of O
the O
flavour O
palette O
improves O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-A
sandwich I-A
on O
a O
roll O
. O

Though O
you O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B-A
with O
what O
seems O
like O
barely O
enough O
room B-A
( O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
size O
of O
your O
party O
), O
the O
warm O
atomosphere B-A
is O
worth O
the O
cramped O
quarters O
- O
you O
' O
ll O
have O
fun O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
tight O
spot B-A
you O
' O
re O
in O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-A
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Considering O
their O
price B-A
of O
$ O
6 O
. O
25 O
for O
lunch B-A
special I-A
, O
the O
dish B-A
was O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

This O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
Indian B-A
Fast I-A
Food I-A
( O
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
). O

Besides O
, O
when O
you O
have O
bad O
service B-A
, O
that O
' O
s O
less O
money B-A
you O
have O
to O
tip B-A
. O

We O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
four O
- O
star O
restaurant O
anymore O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

Service B-A
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-A
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price B-A
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
!!! O

Compared O
to O
Ess O
- O
a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B-A
! O

Ballato O
' O
s O
is O
consistently O
delicious O
authentic O
italian B-A
food I-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky O
Strike O
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
- O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

For O
those O
prices B-A
and O
the O
dressed O
up O
atmosphere B-A
you O
expect O
more O
and O
should O
get O
more O
. O

Then O
, O
IF O
they O
answer O
the O
phone O
, O
you O
' O
re O
lucky O
if O
they O
don O
' O
t O
hang O
up O
on O
you O
! O

They O
offer O
the O
same O
menu B-A
but O
have O
creative O
drinks B-A
that O
are O
loaded O
with O
alcohol O
and O
cheeky O
names O
-- O
but O
they O
do O
cost O
you O
. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
restaurant O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
fun O
atmosphere B-A
and O
good O
food B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-A
. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

highly O

, O
this O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
place B-A
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

You O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service B-A
a O
lot O
. O

Ambiance B-A
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management B-A
tries O
. O

I O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
replacestart B-A
portions I-A
replaceend O
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
( O
especially O
the O
replacestart B-A
appetizer I-A
replaceends I-A
), O
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef B-A
' O
s O
special O
tasting O
menu B-A
, O
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer B-A
( O
1 O
dish B-A
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
replacestart B-A
portions I-A
replaceend O
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
), O
a O
main B-A
entree I-A
, O
and O
the O
cold B-A
udon I-A
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food B-A
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice B-A
. O

After O
we O
got O
our O
sashimi B-A
order O
, O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
small O
the O
portions B-A
were O
! O

After O
the O
main B-A
course I-A
came O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
our O
waiter B-A
for O
at O
least O
40 O
MINUTES O
! O

It O
will O
be O
on O
my O
to O
do O
list O
the O
next O
visit O
to O
NYC O
. O

Nothing O
better O
than O
buying O
a O
snapple B-A
for O
$ O
3 O
. O
25 O
too O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps B-A
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Service B-A
is O
extraordinary O
, O
yet O
not O
overbearing O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-A
brings O
a O
taste O
of O
trendy O
SoHo O
into O
Queens O
. O

The O
dosas B-A
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
' O
d O
drink O
popcorn B-A
topping I-A
before O
I O
' O
d O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
. O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene B-A
and O
annoying O
customers B-A
I O
' O
d O
go O
out O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

After O
a O
seafood B-A
craving O
, O
i O
checked O
citysearch O
and O
chose O
to O
go O
to O
Fish O
based O
on O
a O
previous O
review O
and O
the O
citysearch O
info O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
major O
deegan O
you O
get O
ladies B-A
from O
all O
over O
the O
city O
. O

Until O
you O
realize O
that O
their O
five O
minutes O
is O
meaningless O
and O
your O
wait B-A
may O
be O
anywhere O
from O
two O
to O
twenty O
minutes O
it O
may O
be O
frustrating O
. O

always O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
very O
thai O
. O

Thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-A
serving I-A
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

The O
fillings B-A
may O
be O
unconventional O
but O
the O
dosa B-A
batter I-A
is O
definitely O
authentic O
and O
the O
combinations O
very O
tasty O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-A
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch B-A
, O
dinner B-A
, O
pre B-A
- I-A
theatre I-A
or I-A
after I-A
- I-A
theatre I-A
drinks I-A
! O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
mussaman B-A
curry I-A
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
as O
thin O
as O
water O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
poorly O
fried B-A
tofu I-A
that O
I O
ordered O
in O
it O
, O
they O
graciously O
provided O
me O
with O
ONE O
piece O
of O
poorly O
cooked O
potato B-A
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner B-A
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-A
with O
great O
service B-A
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-A
. O

Their O
sake B-A
martini I-A
is O
wonderful O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-A
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

Bravissimo O
!! O

Once O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
Gnochi B-A
and O
made O
it O
for O
me O
from O
scratch O
! O

We O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Marcelo O
and O
Grace O
for O
a O
wonderful O
dining B-A
experience O
!!! O

Found O
service B-A
above O
average O
, O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
at O
Orsay O
I O
was O
thrown O
back O
, O
in O
a O
veyr O
good O
sense O
. O

Bagels B-A
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

This O
is O
the O
Cheers O
of O
New O
York O
, O
whether O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
there O
or O
not O
. O

It O
' O
s O
to O
die O
for O
! O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

I O
know O
this O
is O
the O
case O
in O
many O
nyc O
eateries O
, O
but O
here O
, O
they O
really O
cram O
you O
in O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
' O
s O
borderline O
uncomfortable O
. O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality B-A
. O

Overall O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
for O
that O
price B-A
category O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
lunch B-A
buffet I-A
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
exceptional O
. O

You O
will O
be O
satisfied O
. O

Another O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
! O

But O
, O
hey O
, O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
with O
a O
decent O
vegetarian O
selection O
in O
Astoria O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

A O
Thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice B-A
during O
dinner B-A
? O

but O
still O
my O
date O
was O
bad O

Would O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao O
' O
s O
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

( O
and O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
) O
Which O
impresses O
me O
for O
having O
such O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
people O
to O
serve B-A
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
setting B-A
is O
nice O
. O

Overall O
a O
worthwhile O
experience O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
prompt O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-A
, O
while O
not O
cheap O
, O
won O
' O
t O
put O
your O
wallet O
out O
of O
commission O
. O

Had O
1 O
appetizer B-A
, O
2 O
entrees B-A
and O
2 O
cokes B-A
and O
the O
bill B-A
was O
~$ O
55 O
. O
00 O
, O
not O
including O
tip O
. O

It O
' O
s O
really O
a O
takeaway O
place O
, O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
sit O
if O
I O
could O
take O
it O
home O

THE O
MOST O
FUN O
RESTAURANT O
I O
HAVE O
EVER O
BEEN O
TOO O
! O

Best O
drumsticks B-A
over I-A
rice I-A
and O
sour B-A
spicy I-A
soup I-A
in O
town O
! O

Some O
of O
the O
finest O
latin O
women O
you O
' O
ll O
see O
in O
your O
life O
hang O
out O
at O
Jimmy O
' O

. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-A
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+. O

Their O
replacestart B-A
whitefish I-A
salad O
replaceend O
is O
excellent O
-- O
all O
whitefish B-A
with O
a O
little O
mayo B-A
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price B-A
( O
congee B-A
, O
noodles B-A
, O
and O
rice B-A
dishes I-A
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O
- O
6 O
each O
). O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
chicken I-A
parm O
replaceend O
was O
edible O
but O
had O
canned O
tomato B-A
replacestart I-A
sauce I-A
replaceend O
and O
boxed O
pasta B-A
and O
the O
replacestart B-A
chicken I-A
with O
portobello O
mushrooms O
replaceend O
consisted O
of O
dry O
, O
inedible O
chicken B-A
with O
terrible O
sauce B-A
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
who O
asks O
me O
where O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-A
. O

The O
waitresses B-A
are O
nice O
-- O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-A
service I-A
sit O
. O

The O
only O
friendly O
staff B-A
member I-A
was O
the O
guy B-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
. O

Having O
been O
a O
long O
time O
Ess O
- O
a O
- O
Bagel O
fan O
, O
I O
was O
surpised O
to O
find O
myself O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
to O
Murray O
' O
s O
. O

Go O
for O
it O
! O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

You O
can O
certainly O
find O
restaurants O
that O
offer O
a O
superior O
fine O
dining O
experience O
, O
but O
for O
superb O
food B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices B-A
, O
La O
Villa O
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
. O

Won O
' O
t O
or O
Can O
' O
t O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service B-A
directory O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-A
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
suggest O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
seated O
upstairs B-A
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
be O
a O
little O
cozy O
. O

To O
speak O
of O
the O
Park O
Side O
, O
words O
can O
not O
describe O
. O

The O
red B-A
curry I-A
is O
weak O
and O
tasteless O
, O
the O
pad B-A
thai I-A
is O
stuck O
together O
and O
lumpy O
, O
the O
rice B-A
is O
often O
overcooked O
, O
and O
the O
seafood B-A
is O
pretty O
sketchy O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced B-A
meal B-A
. O

Saul B-A
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
great O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
' O
s O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-A
. O

We O
always O
get O
a O
sampling O
of O
appetizers B-A
and O
share O
. O

Overall O
I O
was O
impressed O
and O
will O
return O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
QPR O
( O
Quality B-A
to O
Price B-A
Ratio O
). O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table B-A
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner B-A
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

Their O
pad B-A
penang I-A
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
puke O
green O
walls B-A
leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
very O
good O
. O

The O
flavors B-A
are O
very O
fresh O
and O
pretty O
inobtrusive O
, O
nothing O
flashy O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-A
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
!! O

The O
hanger B-A
steak I-A
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-A
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

But O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
??? O

Our O
son O
loves O
pizza B-A
and O
we O
have O
a O
certified O
Neapolitan O
pizza B-A
replaceendria I-A
in I-A
our I-A
home I-A
city I-A
( I-A
Seattle I-A
), I-A
we I-A
liked I-A
this I-A
nearly I-A
as I-A
much I-A
- I-A
and I-A
the I-A
differences I-A
were I-A
more I-A
about I-A
personal I-A
preference I-A
than I-A
any I-A
reflection I-A
on I-A
either I-A
restaurant I-A
. I-A

big O
and O
soft O
as O
well O
as O
good O
lunch B-A
food I-A
. O

No O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
snobs O
allowed O
, O
this O
place O
is O
for O
people O
who O
appreciate O
good O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
food B-A
at O
this O
quasi B-A
- I-A
thai I-A
restaurant O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-A
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast B-A
food I-A
restaurant O
. O

Suan O
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Not O
a O
great O
place O
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

As O
for O
the O
bar B-A
, O
this O
is O
another O
bad O
idea O
. O

Their O
replacestart B-A
bagel I-A
replaceends I-A
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel B-A
experience O
. O

Unlike O
HH O
up O
the O
block O
, O
this O
place O
actually O
gives O
you O
hearty O
and O
hot O
bagels B-A
this O
town O
is O
known O
for O
. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

The O
barebecued B-A
salmon I-A
is O
elegantly O
spiced O
and O
not O
at O
all O
dry O
. O

Same O
owner B-A
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St O
. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

What O
generous O
portions B-A
! O

The O
workers B-A
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-A
with O
cream B-A
cheese I-A
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
). O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

The O
wine B-A
the O
service B-A
was O
very O
good O
too O
. O

So O
, O
the O
menu B-A
is O
written O
in O
chalk O
above O
your O
head O
and O
it O
all O
sounds O
delicious O
. O

The O
highly O
spiced O
chai B-A
tea I-A
was O
great O
too O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
many O
times O
, O
and O
food B-A
is O
good O
and O
consistent O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
is O
the O
best O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
town O
- O
As O
everyone O
says O
, O
the O
Spicy B-A
Tuna I-A
hand I-A
rolls I-A
are O
the O
best O
- O
have O
4 O
of O
these O
, O
and O
you O
' O
ve O
broken O
even O
. O

There O
is O
not O
a O
single O
place O
in O
Chinatown O
where O
you O
have O
a O
nice O
neighborhood O
feeling O
like O
here O
. O

While O
Sapphire O
is O
certainly O
not O
lacking O
in O
ambiance B-A
, O
and O
probably O
has O
the O
best O
decor B-A
of O
any O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
have O
been O
to O
in O
New O
York O
City O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
not O
what O
I O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
atmosphere B-A
that O
whisks O
you O
away O
to O
the O
left O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
Seine O
. O

I O
just O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O
. O

The O
meat B-A
dishes I-A
were O
only O
so O
- O
so O
. O

His O
wife O
Tanya O
, O
the O
hostess B-A
, O
completes O
the O
comforting O
atmosphere B-A
by O
being O
delightfully O
warm O
and O
gracious O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

The O
menu B-A
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere B-A
food I-A
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
longtime O
fan O
of O
Holy O
Basil O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
and O
while O
I O
do O
believe O
their O
food B-A
has O
slightly O
slipped O
in O
quality B-A
, O
I O
have O
been O
hesitant O
to O
be O
disloyal O
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere B-A
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

For O
an O
untrendy O
rip O
- O
off O
- O
eat O
here O
. O

And O
you O
' O
re O
hungry O
a O
few O
hours O
later O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
HATE O
HATE O
HATE O
this O
place O
. O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-A
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

The O
staff B-A
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

You O
don O
' O
t O
go O
to O
Mizu O
for O
excellent O
service B-A
, O
you O
go O
for O
the O
large O
amounts O
of O
food B-A
, O
the O
amiable O
atmosphere B-A
, O
and O
the O
hole O
- O
in O
- O
the O
- O
wall O
feeling O
of O
the O
place O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
always O
bad O
though O
, O
don O
' O
t O
expect O
much O
of O
anything O
from O
your O
server B-A
, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
bringing O
a O
date O
here O
either O
. O

Monday O

I O
have O

Great O

of O
a O
delicate B-A
butternut I-A

entree I-A
to O
a O
dessert B-A
that O
I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
because O
of O
the O
fabulous O
Cakebread B-A
Cabernet I-A
we O
were O
drinking O
-- O
the O
whole O
evening O
was O
amazing O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-A
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they O
' O
re O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B-A
and O
fix O
drinks B-A
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B-A
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O
. O

The O
makhani B-A
was O
OK O
-- O
the O
korma B-A
was O
bland O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
inventive O
but O
still O
keeps O
traditional O
indian O
flavoring O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
WOW O
! O

though O
the O
service B-A
could O
be O
better O
( O
possibly O
due O
to O
more O
than O
one O
very O
large O
group O
in O
the O
house O
), O
it O
is O
very O
cordial O
and O
warm O
, O
as O
is O
the O
general O
clientele O
. O

The O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
decor O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
in O
this O
place B-A
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-A
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

This O
is O
a O
cute O
place B-A
and O
could O
be O
good O
but O
they O
need O
to O
get O
their O
act O
together O
. O

The O
lox B-A
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Sure O
enough O
, O
exactly O
30 O
minutes O
later O
we O
got O
the O
call O
and O
were O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

So O
all O
I O
' O
m O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai B-A
food I-A
restaurant O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

Food B-A
was O
OK O
- O
fish B-A
was O
cooked O
well O
. O

We O
actually O
left O
hungry O
and O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Wo O
Hop O
at O
15 O
Mott O
street O
for O
some O
good O
chinese B-A
food I-A
. O

The O
duck B-A
confit I-A
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-A
gras I-A
terrine I-A
with I-A
figs I-A
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe O
Noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-A
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

The O
service B-A
does O
sometimes O
lack O
focus O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ideal O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
but O
I O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
rudely O
. O

The O
staff B-A
offers O
impeccable O
service B-A
. O

The O
catch O
is O
that O
you O
are O
charged O
extra O
for O
ANYTHING O
that O
you O
leave O
on O
your O
plate O
so O
don O
' O
t O
be O
a O
greedy O
pig O
! O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-A
Jamun I-A
( I-A
dessert I-A
) I-A
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter B-A
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

This O
place O
doesn O
' O
t O
compare O
with O
Mamoun O
' O
s O
in O
terms O
of O
price B-A
, O
freshness B-A
, O
value B-A
, O
and O
consisent O
quality B-A
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
just O
my O
opinion O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
playfull O
and O
i O
will O
return O
again O
frequently O
. O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years O
, O
Emilio O
( O
the O
Godfather O
) O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B-A
and O
wine B-A
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices B-A
. O

The O
brioche B-A
and I-A
lollies I-A
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal B-A
. O

After O
being O
told O
that O
our O
party O
of O
three O
would O
be O
seated O
in O
10 O
minutes O
and O
watching O
other O
parties O
( O
multiples O
of O
2 O
and O
higher O
) O
seated O
for O
40 O
minutes O
, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
were O
squished O
into O
a O
small O
2 B-A
- I-A
person I-A
table I-A
. O

And O
the O
bill B-A
was O
outragous O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced B-A
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O

staff I-A

Bon O

Salads B-A
were O
fantastic O
. O

The O
owners B-A
and O
employees B-A
are O
friendly O
and O
their O
pizza B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

La O
Rosa O
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-A
in I-A
spicy I-A
tomato I-A
sauce I-A
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
Smith O
Street O
: O
finally O
, O
a O
place O
that O
' O
s O
not O
pretentious O
and O
filled O
with O
women O
wearing O
Ugg O
boots O
. O

skip O

We O
spent O
$ O
200 O
in O
this O
place O
and O
left O
hungry O
and O
very O
disappointed O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel B-A
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O
. O

It O
was O
like O
the O
servers B-A
forgot O
that O
they O
actually O
worked O
there O
and O
instead O
wanted O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
be O
cool O
. O

I O
liked O
this O
place O
the O
first O
time O
but O
doubt O
I O
will O
ever O
return O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
good O
and O
ambience B-A
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

A O
great O
way O
to O
make O
some O
money O
is O
to O
buy O
a O
case B-A
of I-A
snapple I-A
from O
Costco O
and O
sell O
it O
right O
outside O
for O
only O

. O

It O
' O

all O
about O
the O
food B-A

Fast O

Skip O
this O

The O

more O

we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

At O
6 O
: O
30 O
, O
we O
were O
the O
third O
party O
there O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food B-A
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere B-A
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

No O
, O
really O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
but O
very O
expensive O
for O
the O
casualness O
of O
it O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Naples O
45 O
for O
dinner B-A
twice O
. O

The O
hot O
and O
sour O
soup B-A
was O
unbearably O
hot O
and O
tasted O
of O
only O
pepper B-A
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

i O
love O
the O
pics O
of O
andy O
warhol O
when O
he O
used O
to O
frequent O
the O
place O
( O
he O
painted O
the O
ballato O
' O
s O
sign O
in O
the O
window O
). O

Try O
sushimi B-A
cucumber I-A
roll I-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
. O

Their O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
replaceends I-A
by I-A
the I-A
glass I-A
are O
a O
great O
accompaniment O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
like O
a O
king O
with O
wine B-A
for O
under O
$ O
30 O
. O

This O
place B-A
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-A
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-A
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Amma O
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

Yeah O
Shanghai O
is O
also O
great O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
-- O
they O
use O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
salt B-A
but O
without O
sweetness O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
sushi B-A
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

Worth O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
, O
or O
any O
time O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
much O
better O
than O
Sripraphai O
( O
more O
modern O
and O
sleek O
). O

I O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
dress O
up O
and O
impress O
the O
lady O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

The O
bagels B-A
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

I O
had O
a O
late O
dinner B-A
at O
Lucky O
Stike O
, O
a O
great O
name O
for O
a O
joint O
if O
ever O
I O
saw O
one O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

Definitely O
a O
once O
a O
year O
treat O
that O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
around O
the O
holidays O
! O

Service B-A
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

from O
an O
English O
speaking O
staff B-A
. O

Anyhow O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
sit O
as O
long O
as O
we O
wanted O
and O
chat O
, O
which O
was O
nice O
. O

And O
they O
have O
these O
home O
made O
potato B-A
chips I-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
that O
are O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
in O
the O
world O
! O

A O
defitely O
must O
visit O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
each O
of O
the O
6 O
taste O
size O
portions B-A
and O
left O
completely O
full O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
a O
table B-A
. O

We O
all O
ate O
pasta B-A
entre I-A
' I-A
es I-A
, O
which O
were O
great O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
showed O
up O
on O
a O
Sat O
. O

The O
steak B-A
was O
excellent O
and O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
had O
( O
I O
tasted O
the O
butter B-A
intitally O
but O
in O
no O
way O
did O
it O
overwhelm O
the O
flavor B-A
of O
the O
meat B-A
). O

great O
experience O
overall O
. O

PERFECT O
FOR O
DATES O
! O

The O
food B-A
was O
boring O
and O
expensive O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch B-A
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Terrific O
menu B-A
full O
of O
unique O
rolls B-A
and O
special O
dishes B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
ok O
but O
could O
be O
better O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-A
, O
drinks B-A
, O
and O
atmosphere B-A
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-A
service I-A
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

( O
I O
' O
ve O
ordered O
from O
the O
2nd O
ave O
. O

Nothing O
against O
a O
good O
sales O
call O
, O
but O
the O
tactics O
at O
Amma O
are O
just O
too O
obvious O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster B-A
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-A
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B-A
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother O
' O
s O
Day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B-A
d I-A
' I-A
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
each O
time O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B-A
bar I-A
( O
chef B-A
Yoshi O
) O
and O
ordered O
everything O
ala B-A
carte I-A
. O

The O
vibe B-A
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-A
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
! O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside O
table B-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality B-A
, O
cheap O
eats O
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

However O
, O
for O
what O
we O
spent O
, O
overall O
, O
it O
just O
was O
not O
up O
to O
par O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
casual O
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8 O
: O
30 O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-A
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

I O
recommend O
their O
Pad B-A
See I-A
Ew I-A
, O
Pork B-A
Chops I-A
or O
Tofu B-A
plates I-A
. O

Never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
I O
think O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B-A
and O
in O
quantity B-A
for O
$ O
3 O
. O
00 O
in O
NYC O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
secret O
place O
in O
midtown O
', O
I O
heard O
that O
from O
the O
replacestart B-A
bar I-A
replaceendtender I-A
, O
after O
having O
brilliant O
food B-A
( O
try O
steak B-A
with I-A
portobello I-A
mushrooms I-A
) O
and O
drinks B-A
on O
the O
bar B-A
last O
Tuesday O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
main B-A
course I-A
had O
an O
average O
portion B-A
, O
and O
was O
decent O
overall O
. O

20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation B-A
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails B-A
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B-A
and O
each O
other O
. O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

Waitstaff B-A
is O
great O
, O
very O
attentive O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

The O
dinner B-A
menu I-A
is O
diverse O
and O
top O
- O
notch O
as O
well O
. O

IT O
IS O
WHAT O
MODERN O
CUISINE B-A
IS O
ALL O
ABOUT O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
even O
though O
its O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
, O
we O
still O
love O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

I O
definitely O
will O
go O
back O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
like O
Indian B-A
food I-A
too O
much O
and O
this O
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
you O
want O
to O
factor O
that O
into O
the O
equation O
. O

at O
taj O
, O
vegetarians O
can O
rejoice O
- O
all O
the O
dishes B-A
are O
manna O
from O
heaven O
. O

Forget O
the O
rush B-A
and O
the O
wait B-A
and O
the O
noise B-A
( O
which O
isn O
' O
t O
actually O
that O
bad O
), O
I O
mean O
please O
, O
who O
goes O
to O
a O
steakhouse O
to O
be O
coddled O
and O
romantic O
? O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

I O
won O
' O
t O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill B-A
. O

We O
live O
in O
New O
Jersey O
and O
whenever O
we O
go O
into O
New O
York O
City O
we O
buy O
bagels B-A
to O
eat O
hot O
and O
then O
to O
freeze O
( O
they O
told O
me O
that O
if O
I O
call O
in O
the O
order O
, O
they O
' O
d O
bring O
it O
out O
to O
the O
car O
so O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
have O
to O
look O
for O
parking O
). O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

Jimmy O
' O
s O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
hottest O
night O
spot B-A
in O
the O
Bronx O
. O

And O
I O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
masses O
in O
terms O
of O
service B-A
- O
delivery B-A
is O
their O
Achilles O
' O
heel O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
have O
been O
to O
The O
Minnow O
four O
times O
now O
and O
we O
have O
consistently O
been O
impressed O
. O

The O
$ O
300 O
bill B-A
was O
a O
bit O
steep O
, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
mind O
going O
back O
some O
time O
, O
but O
not O
before O
trying O
others O
nearby O
. O

Nice O
ambiance B-A
, O
nice O
little O
bar B-A
, O
good O
bar B-A
replaceendtender I-A
, I-A
Francois I-A
, I-A
and I-A
good I-A
replacestart I-A
service I-A
. O

I O
found O
this O
restaurant O
to O
be O
one O
that O
truly O
values O
its O
patrons O
. O

The O
calamari B-A
comes O
with O
an O
incredible O
sauce B-A
, O
and O
the O
duck B-A
noodles I-A
are O
yummy O
as O
well O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
-- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B-A
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
when O
we O
got O
in O
and O
remained O
so O
for O
the O
entire O
evening O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
why O
but O
we O
had O
a O
blast O
and O
will O
definately O
go O
back O
the O
next O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Simple O
comfort B-A
food I-A
and O
what O
hot O
and O
lage O
portions B-A
. O

But O
I O
just O
would O
like O
to O
say O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
people O
left O
and O
thats O
why O
I O
checked O
it O
out O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
two O
specialty O
rolls B-A
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
though O
- O
too O
much O
avocado B-A
and O
rice B-A
will O
fill O
you O
up O
right O
quick O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
drink B-A
refills I-A
and O
she O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
offer O
us O
the O
option O
of O
dessert B-A
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

The O
bagels B-A
are O
also O
reasonably O
priced B-A
for O
NYC O
. O

If O
you O
can O
handle O
that O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
business B-A
dinner I-A
, O
fun O
with O
friends O
or O
simply O
a O
table B-A
for O
2 O
. O

Decor B-A
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O
! O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-A
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
. O

Our O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
waiter O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
was O
fine O
, O
the O
place B-A
looks O
nice O
in O
that O
not O
- O
trying O
- O
too O
- O
hard O
way O
, O
but O
at O
those O
prices B-A
, O
a O
little O
more O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
your O
food B-A
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
' O
s O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings B-A
!) O

When O
my O
husband O
and O
go O
there O
, O
we O
spend O
$ O
60 O
. O
00 O
( O
have O
LOBSTER B-A
TAILS I-A
UMMMMM O
need O
I O
say O
more O
) O
I O
can O
' O
t O
say O
any O
more O
, O
it O
a O
place B-A
you O
' O
ll O
never O
forget O
If O
you O
never O
go O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
miss O
A O
Meal B-A
of O
your O
life O
time O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
increase O
turnover O
, O
the O
restaurant O
offers O
no O
desserts B-A
beyond O
the O
complimentary O
espresso B-A
cup I-A
filled I-A
with I-A
chocolate I-A
mousse I-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
times O
and O
when O
I O
' O
m O
craving O
for O
Pho B-A
, O
Lemon B-A
grass I-A
chicken I-A
or O
Beef B-A
Cube I-A
on I-A
rice I-A
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
Indian O
oldies O
film O
stars O
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
portraits B-A
of O
Indian O
actors O
and O
actresses O
in O
classic O
black O
white O
that O
adorn O
the O
walls O
, O
some O
of O
which O
, O
I O
would O
love O
to O
know O
where O
they O
obtained O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
spectacular O
, O
from O
the O
appitizers B-A
to O
the O
main B-A
course I-A
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
the O
desserts B-A
, O
( O
WOW O
) O
you O
' O
ll O
need O
no O
more O
. O

The O
neighborhood O
was O
nice O
though O
so O
check O
out O
another O
restaurant O
instead O
. O

My O
fish B-A
was O
delicious O
in O
an O
incredible O
curry B-A
sauce I-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
search O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
NYC O
deli B-A
experience O
look O
no O
further O
than O
the O
famous O
and O
historic O
Katz O
' O
s O
Deli O
down O
on O
the O
Lower O
East O
Side O
. O

Even O
upon O
delivery O
, O
their O
juicy O
pork B-A
buns I-A
are O
quite O
good O
. O
. O

This O
is O
also O
where O
I O
was O
from O
. O

Everything O
is O
for O
sale O
in O
here O
including O
the O
sculptured O
iron O
statue O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-A
. O

The O
space B-A
is O
nice O
but O
when O
we O
order O
our O
drink B-A
we O
were O
in O
for O
a O
surprise O
. O

The O
entire O
place B-A
and O
the O
treatment O
we O
received O
felt O
as O
a O
conveyor O
belt O
. O

Joe O
' O
s O
Pizza O
used O
to O
have O
the O
best O
slice B-A
until O
this O
pizzeria O
opened O
up O
. O

I O
in O
all O
reality O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
off O
Air O
France O
and O
was O
in O
the O
8th O
District O
in O
Paris O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
it O
! O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
shouldn O
' O
t O
. O

And O
they O
provided O
a O
delicious O
dessert B-A
on O
the O
house O
! O

They O
are O
still O
living O
in O
the O
dark O
ages O
and O
do O
not O
have O
an O
answering O
machine O
, O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-A
you O
are O
limited O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B-A
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-A
. O

Food B-A
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
had O
Lobster B-A
Bisque I-A
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
. O
of O
Maine B-A
Lobster I-A
in O
it O
. O

I O
am O
Indian O
, O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
many O
Indian O
places O
in O
NY O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-A
Thai I-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices B-A
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

On O
a O
recent O
Saturday O
night O
, O
I O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
at O
the O
Bread O
Bar O
. O

Food B-A
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

The O
price B-A
very O
reasonable O
. O

Dessert B-A
- O
can O
' O
t O
be O
missed O
, O
so O
save O
room O
!!! O

It O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
, O
but O
once O
the O
food B-A
is O
ordered O
, O
you O
are O
in O
for O
a O
treat O
. O

Take O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
humor O
, O
an O
American O
express O
card O
with O
no O
limit O
, O
walk O
out O
with O
a O
lollipop O
, O
gift O
bag O
in O
hand O
and O
enough O
marketing O
materials O
for O
alain O
to O
to O
take O
the O
show O
on O
the O
road O

Ingredients B-A
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

It O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
actually O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
my O
food B-A
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
fine O
cuisine B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices B-A
. O

This O
is O
, O
by O
far O
, O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
and O
I O
only O
wish O
it O
were O
more O
affordable O
so O
I O
could O
go O
more O
often O
! O

The O
staff B-A
was O
very O
attentive O
, O
the O
ambience B-A
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
superb O
. O

I O
love O
when O
restaurants O
think O
using O
fancy O
expensive O
ingrediants B-A
makes O
the O
food B-A
fine O
cuisine B-A
, O
even O
with O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
use O
them O
. O

THe O
Pizza B-A
and O
wine B-A
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-A
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-A
dining I-A
area I-A
. O

THE O
FRANKENSTEIN O
SHOW O
WAS O
THE O
BEST O
. O

The O
waiters B-A
are O
sweet O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
bill B-A
is O
never O
too O
large O
. O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
superb O
, O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
. O

We O
all O
had O
the O
tasting O
menu B-A
and O
unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
felt O
there O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food B-A
. O

It O
only O
took O
about O
five O
or O
so O
minutes O
to O
get O
an O
empty O
table B-A
, O
but O
standing O
up O
wasn O
' O
t O
too O
bad O
. O

The O
menu B-A
may O
be O
small O
, O
but O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
delicious O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

They O
had O
scrapped O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
they O
make O
the O
rice B-A
- O
RESULT O
- O
WE O
HAD O
LARGE O
CHUNKS O
OF O
BURNT O
RICE B-A
IN O
OUR O
SERVING O
BOWL O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Stumbled O
upon O
this O
gem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
and O
I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
frequently O
. O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
' O
s O
frequently O
. O

- O
for O
dessert B-A
we O
split O
chocolate B-A
cake I-A
and O
vanilla B-A
gelato I-A
( I-A
with I-A
espresso I-A
) I-A
, O
which O
were O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

When O
I O
visited O
my O
friend O
who O
lives O
in O
the O
Upper O
Eastside O
, O
she O
recommended O
that O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Warm O
, O
comfortable O
surroundings B-A
, O
nice O
appointments O
( O
witness O
the O
etched O
glass O
and O
brickwork O
separating O
the O
dining B-A
rooms I-A
). O

We O
ran O
a O
little O
late O
for O
the O
reservation B-A
but O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
problem O
to O
get O
our O
table B-A
immediately O
. O

Kudos O
Haru O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B-A
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O
The O

I O
plan O
on O
eating O
here O
more O
often O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
for O
a O
very O
special O
occasion O
, O
but O
not O
for O
regular O
fine O
dining B-A
. O

The O
well O
mannered O
, O
pleasant O
staff B-A
that O
Tony O
has O
in O
his O
employ O
. O

The O
flavors B-A
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
$ O
2 O
pints O
during O
happy O
hour O
and O
the O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O
oysters B-A
you O
' O
ll O
find O
in O
the O
city O
, O
though O
the O
quality B-A
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
. O

I O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-A
to O
eat O
, O
it O
just O
is O
not O
THAT O
great O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-A
chocolate I-A
cake I-A
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

The O
counter B-A
service I-A
is O
bad O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
! O

Service B-A
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-A
was O
fantastic O
. O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-A
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

and O
we O
were O
thouroughly O
disapointed O
. O

This O
is O
the O
Jackel O
and O
Hideof O
the O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UES O
. O

The O
sauce B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
crust B-A
is O
perfect O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

Since O
my O
first O
dinner B-A
I O
have O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
have O
brunch B-A
at O
Orsay O
3x O
. O

You O
will O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
decore B-A
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
no O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
Chinese O
and O
Asian O
fusion O
places O
in O
NY O
. O

They O
have O
some O
great O
entrees B-A
here O
as O
well O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
-- O
just O
decent O
. O

The O
food B-A
, O
served B-A
in O
small O
tasting O
portions B-A
( O
as O
an O
option O
) O
is O
very O
good O
with O
each O
dish B-A
being O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

You O
guys O
are O
awesome O
! O

They O
do O
cater B-A
to O
American O
palates O
, O
but O
if O
you O
like O
it O
hot O
let O
them O
know O
and O
they O
are O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
oblige O
! O

I O
loved O
this O
place O
!! O

I O
had O
the O
mango B-A
chicken I-A
and O
i O
can O
' O
t O
go O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
delicious O
that O
was O
and O
the O
presentation B-A
was O
beatiful O
. O

I O
care O
more O
about O
the O
food B-A
and O
ambience B-A
. O

Oh O
, O
but O
wait O
, O
we O
were O
out O
of O
drinks B-A
( O
which O
were O
also O
delightfully O
overpriced O
). O

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
for O
any O
occasion O
! O

The O
service B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
try O
this O
hidden O
spot O
which O
will O
surely O
blowup O
very O
soon O

The O
garlic B-A
mashed I-A
potatoes I-A
are O
hands O
down O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Food B-A
and O
service B-A
was O
okay O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

The O
lamb B-A
meat I-A
was O
under O
- O
cooked O
and O
EXTRMELY O
CHEWY O
. O

The O
best O
pad B-A
thai I-A
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
the O
food B-A
quality I-A
has O
decreased O
substantially O
, O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
crowded O
than O
it O
used O
to O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
must O
definitely O
be O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
. O

Great O
pizza B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

We O
were O
seated O
outside B-A
and O
the O
waiter B-A
spilled O
red B-A
wine I-A
and O
hot B-A
tea I-A
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil B-A
next O
time O
. O

While O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
place B-A
in O
that O
overly O
cute O
French O
way O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
insultingly O
horrible O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

I O
really O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
literally O
overlooks O
the O
main O
hall O
of O
Grand O
Central O
. O

None O
of O
that O
yucky O
whipped O
stuff O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
isn O
' O
t O
great O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-A
are O
shipped O
in O
from O
Bruno O
' O
s O
down O
the O
street O
, O
which O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
Lassi B-A
and O
asked O
4 O
times O
for O
it O
but O
never O
got O
it O
. O

Their O
coffee B-A
is O
quite O
good O
too O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
. O

great O
wine B-A
list I-A
( O
italian O
), O
good O
food B-A
, O
service B-A
was O
INITIALLY O
fine O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
space B-A
is O
large O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
overcrowded O
the O
floor O
with O
tables B-A
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
' O
m O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
service B-A
goes O
, O
the O
waitresses B-A
were O
not O
particularly O
friendly O
, O
but O
they O
got O
the O
job O
done O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place B-A
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish B-A
Ive O
requested O
. O

Normally O
that O
would O
be O
improper O
, O
however O
they O
were O
all O
delicious O
and O
my O
host B-A
did O
not O
complain O
. O

Taxan B-A
delicious O
! O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
an O
off O
night O
, O
but O
it O
was O
suprisingly O
average O
for O
a O
9 O
. O
3 O
rating O
. O

Unlike O
other O
places O
in O
NYC O
where O
the O
sandwiches B-A
you O
want O
only O
come O
as O
a O
triple O
- O
decker O
, O
here O
you O
can O
get O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
reasonably O
- O
sized O
portion B-A
( O
and O
price B-A
). O

Southern B-A
Indian I-A
cuisine I-A
is O
still O
there O
, O
too O
. O

Restaurant O
snobs O
need O
not O
bother O
, O
this O
is O
a O
small O
, O
neighborhood O
kind O
of O
place B-A
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

They O
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
make O
a O
salad B-A
that O
was O
appealing O
. O

For O
two O
people O
with O
tip B-A
was O
less O
than O
$ O
25 O
bucks O
. O

Killer O
Sushi B-A
! O

Of O
course O
the O
reason O
its O
so O
packed O
is O
because O
the O
food B-A
is O
so O
delicious O
! O

Staffs B-A
are O
not O
that O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
taste B-A
covers O
all O
. O

The O
jukebox B-A
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

And O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

This O
place O
is O
always O
packed O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Plus O
they O
made O
a O
perfect O
martini B-A
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
call O
the O
food B-A
here O
Indian O
as O
it O
is O
a O
fusion O
of O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
French O
with O
an O
Indian O
or O
exotic O
touch O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
thai O
many O
times O
, O
and O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B-A
. O

The O
waiter B-A
was O
attentive O
. O

Their O
Margarita B-A
is O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
since O
I O
' O
ve O
returned O
from O
Naples O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant O
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

The O
tastes B-A
makes O
your O
mouth O
water O
for O
more O
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

Their O
sake B-A
list I-A
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple B-A
Haze I-A
, O
which O
wasn O
' O
t O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
tables B-A
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-A
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
, O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

after O
dining O
at O
B O
. O
O O
. O
G O
over O
twenty O
times O
now O
, O
its O
official O
! O

They O
are O
served B-A
with O
a O
free O
appetizer B-A
and O
the O
portions B-A
are O
perfect O
for O
lunch B-A
. O

There O
is O
actually O
space B-A
to O
breathe O
and O
the O
decor B-A
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-A
. O

We O
went O
around O
9 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-A
was O
great O
! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak B-A
, O
medium O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-A
had O
no O
seasoning B-A
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-A
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

This O
place O
has O
realy O
fresh O
sushi B-A
and O
a O
nice O
large O
menu B-A
of O
Japanese B-A
classic I-A
cuisine I-A
. O

The O
sushi B-A
is O
average O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
anything O
but O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
spinach B-A
, O
the O
Shanghai B-A
low I-A
mein I-A
, O
and O
other O
attractions O
. O

Owner B-A
must O
have O
coem O
on O
this O
website O
to O
give O
himself O
credit O
. O

Turned O
out O
there O
was O
full O
service B-A
upstairs O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

Definitely O
will O
be O
back O
! O

Several O
of O
the O
dim B-A
sum I-A
orders I-A
had O
about O
6 O
- O
8 O
pieces O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
. O

they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
thai O
way O
of O
living O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
dumpling B-A
fetish O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
here O
! O

Three O
page O
wine B-A
menu I-A
, O
one O
page O
entree B-A
and O
horedevous B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-A
has O
always O
been O
accomodating O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
waiters B-A
and O
owners B-A
were O
nonchalant O
about O
this O
and O
promised O
to O
call O
the O
exterminator O
but O
weren O
' O
t O
as O
dismayed O
or O
apologetic O
as O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
. O

I O
live O
nearby O
and O
when O
they O
first O
opened O
, O
I O
ate O
there O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
the O
food B-A
was O
fantastic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
' O
d O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
, O
have O
a O
drink B-A
and O
conversations O
with O
friends O
, O
go O
to O
sweet O
- O
n O
- O
tart O
and O
order O
yourself O
a O
hong B-A
- I-A
kong I-A
styled I-A
milk I-A
and O
tea B-A
with I-A
tapioca I-A
pearls I-A
( I-A
hot I-A
) I-A
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea B-A
Urchin I-A
, O
the O
chef B-A
recommended O
an O
assortment B-A
of I-A
fish I-A
including O
Fatty B-A
Yellow I-A
Tail I-A
, O
Boton B-A
Shrimp I-A
, O
Blue B-A
Fin I-A
Torro I-A
( I-A
Fatty I-A
Tuna I-A
) I-A
, O
Sea B-A
Eel I-A
, O
etc O
. O

They O
' O
re O
also O
friendlier O
here O
, O
especially O
the O
owner B-A
, O
Kenny O
. O

While O
the O
room B-A
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
, O
once O
you O
' O
re O
seated O
you O
' O
ll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what O
' O
s O
on O
your O
plate B-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
NYC O
all O
my O
life O
and O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
so O
many O
waterbugs B-A
in O
one O
place O
( O
except O
in O
a O
really O
bad O
dream O
). O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff B-A
are O
the O
best O
crew B-A
you O
can O
find O
serving B-A
you O
. O

The O
ambiance B-A
is O
minimal O
the O
food B-A
is O
not O
phenomenal O
, O
but O
some O
dishes B-A
are O
quite O
good O
, O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B-A
parmesan I-A
, O
veal B-A
in I-A
carozza I-A
chicken I-A
saltimbocca I-A
. O

My O
host B-A
asked O
for O
appetizers B-A
for O
the O
group O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
gave O
us O
not O
only O
what O
we O
ordered O
, O
but O
some O
other O
items O
that O
were O
not O
ordered O
. O

You O
can O
even O
get O
packages O
of O
the O
chutneys B-A
to O
stock O
your O
fridge O
! O

The O
bar B-A
has O
various O
selections O
and O
the O
mixed B-A
drink I-A
special I-A
is O
a O
catcher O
! O
2 O
for O
1 O
' O
s O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

If O
it O
isn O
' O
t O
for O
the O
food B-A
( O
A O
+++), O
it O
must O
be O
the O
service B-A
or O
the O
ambience B-A
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-A
and O
staff B-A
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant O
. O

We O
were O
exploring O
Grand O
Central O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
food O
court O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money B-A
. O

This O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B-A
. O

We O
left O
after O
one O
drink B-A
. O

Everything O
that O
happened O
was O
not O
even O
up O
to O
mediocre O
. O

Our O
last O
time O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
was O
early O
at O
5pm O
and O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
and O
noisy O
. O

Pick O
a O
bagel O
has O
the O
best O
bagels B-A
in O
the O
city O
. O

You O
are O
paying O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-A
, O
which O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
can O
be O
had O
in O
numerous O
places O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O
. O

It O
' O
s O
called O
Gnochi O
alla O
nona O
and O
is O
found O
under O
Chef O
Specials O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Yes O
you O
have O
to O
wait B-A
to O
be O
seat B-A
replaceended I-A
and I-A
because I-A
its I-A
small I-A
there I-A
is I-A
no I-A
replacestart I-A
replacestart I-A
wait I-A
replaceending I-A
area I-A
and O
the O
seat B-A
at O
the O
bar B-A
was O
all O
taken O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-A
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-A
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor B-A
of O
the O
dish B-A
. O

The O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
are O
GREAT O
! O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-A
ribs I-A
in O
the O
city O
. O

Ive O
been O
here O
so O
many O
times O
the O
waiters B-A
know O
my O
name O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
frequenting O
The O
Tasting O
Room O
since O
it O
first O
arrived O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

We O
figured O
we O
never O
had O
Argentinian B-A
Pizza I-A
before O
so O
we O
grabbed O
our O
lunch B-A
there O
, O
sharing O
a O
large O
Pelligrino B-A
, O
a O
pizza B-A
of O
two O
of O
their O
specials O
, O
one O
was O
goat B-A
cheese I-A
the O
other O
blue B-A
cheese I-A
, O
and O
both O
were O
excellent O
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
start O
or O
finish O
your O
day O
. O

The O
' O
kamasutra B-A
' O
and O
' O
bombay B-A
cosmopolitan I-A
' O
are O
excellent O
and O
will O
have O
you O
tipsy O
in O
no O
time O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date B-A
spot I-A
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O
. O

The O
dim B-A
sum I-A
here O
is O
only O
so O
- O
so O
. O

It O
was O
raining O
, O
and O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
? O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B-A
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-A
. O

Another O
welcome O
addition O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

Seating B-A
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there O
' O
s O
alot O
of O
people O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
into O
detail O
. O

Even O
with O
a O
relatively O
inexpensive O
botle B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
, O
if O
you O
can O
call O
$ O
70 O
. O
00 O
inexpensive O
, O
the O
cost B-A
is O
through O
the O
roof O
for O
better O
than O
average O
fare O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-A
were O
friendly O
. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

The O
steak B-A
was O
very O
fatty O
and O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

My O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
literally O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
the O
people O
next O
to O
you O
! O

And O
affordable O
. O

The O
staff B-A
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
is O
WONDERFUL O
! O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
alright O
- O
some O
stuff O
is O
good O
- O
some O
is O
not O
( O
like O
the O
steak B-A
dish I-A
which O
tends O
to O
be O
dry O
). O

Not O
only O
would O
I O
not O
recommend O
Jimmy O
' O
s O
restaurants O
to O
friends O
, O
I O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
they O
go O
anywhere O
but O
. O

They O
have O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B-A
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O
. O

Haru O
on O
Park O
S O
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

The O
staff B-A
was O
too O
busy O
ordering O
sushi B-A
for O
dinner B-A
and O
then O
laying O
it O
out O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
bar B-A
to O
even O
bring O
me O
my O
check B-A
. O

As O
a O
long O
- O
time O
patron O
of O
Mamoun O
' O
s O
, O
I O
always O
figured O
that O
I O
had O
found O
the O
best O
late O
night O
food B-A
spot I-A
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
drop O
more O
dollar O
bills O
here O
than O
your O
uncle O
after O
a O
weekend O
at O
Scores O
. O

The O
bagel B-A
was O
huge O
. O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-A
of O
gari O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-A
, O
chai B-A
, O
and O
the O
chole B-A
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-A
and O
dhal B-A
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
surprise O
. O

Edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices B-A
given O
whats O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
staff B-A
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B-A
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

I O
am O
French O
and O
I O
really O
felt O
like O
home O
!!! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir O
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

It O
' O
s O
usually O
packed O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
esp O
. O

Service B-A
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

I O
love O
going O
there O
! O

I O
cannot O
recommend O
OG O
more O
highly O
if O
I O
tried O
- O
check O
it O
out O
for O
yourself O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place O
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

Great O
food B-A
, O
great O
decor B-A
, O
great O
service B-A
. O

And O
, O
atlhough O
tables B-A
opened O
up O
next O
to O
us O
and O
we O
ASKED O
for O
a O
slightly O
larger O
space B-A
, O
they O
left O
us O
awkardly O
seated O
. O

The O
palak B-A
paneer I-A
was O
standard O
, O
and O
I O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
malai B-A
kofta I-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
dined O
at O
Alain O
Ducasse O
' O
s O
restaurant O
in O
Monte O
Carlo O
for O
half O
the O
price B-A
for O
the O
same O
excellent O
dining B-A
experience O
. O

Yeah O
, O
sometimes O
the O
service B-A
can O
be O
slow O
. O

There O
was O
no O
ambiance B-A
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
don O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
calories O
, O
go O
to O
Margharita O
' O
s O
on O
Washington O
Street O
instead O
, O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B-A
and O
the O
BEST O
service B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
and O
each O
dish B-A
we O
tried O
was O
wonderful O
from O
the O
spring B-A
rolls I-A
to O
the O
cod B-A
with I-A
pineapple I-A
tempura I-A
. O

But O
trust O
me O
it O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
place O
for O
tourists O
or O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
dined O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot O
. O

The O
only O
weird O
thing O
was O
if O
we O
got O
a O
bottle B-A
, O
the O
waitress B-A
would O
have O
simply O
multiplied O
the O
glass O
price B-A
X4 O
, O
which O
makes O
no O
sense O
whatsoever O
. O

They O
sell O
special O
sushi B-A
, O
everything O
have O
a O
topping B-A
, O
sauce B-A
and O
etc O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste B-A
. O

They O
never O
came O
back O
to O
refill O
our O
glasses O
again O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
service O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
' O
s O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
there O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O
night O
and O
we O
had O
a O
relaxing O
, O
really O
good O
meal B-A
. O

I O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
disappointed O

a O
nice O
place B-A

to O
be O
the O

. O

Best O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-A

Going O
to O
Volare O
is O
like O
going O
to O
your O
favorite O
aunt O
' O
s O
house O
for O
dinner B-A
, O
assuming O
that O
your O
aunt O
is O
a O
great O
Italian O
cook O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
has O
been O
from O
average O
to O
below O
average O
, O
the O
wait B-A
service I-A
has O
always O
been O
sub O
- O
par O
the O
atmosphere B-A
goes O
from O
nice O
to O
really O
irritating O
( O
if O
you O
sit O
in O
the O
area B-A
beyond O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
acousitcs O
are O
horrid O
, O
everything O
echoes O
is O
extremely O
loud O
). O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

Frites B-A
were O
delicious O
if O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
thick O
side O
. O

SO O
SO O
SO O
SO O
SO O
good O
! O

Alone O
for O
100 O
bucks O
, O
it O
is O
really O
overprice O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

Very O
good O
value O

Here O
you O
get O
the O
zen B-A
feel I-A
without O
feeling O
rigid O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
putting O
your O
name O
down O
and O
then O
getting O
a O
drink B-A
at O
a O
local O
bar B-A
first O
though O
because O
of O
the O
wait B-A
time I-A
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg B-A
noodles I-A
in I-A
the I-A
beef I-A
broth I-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
dumplings I-A
and I-A
slices I-A
of I-A
BBQ I-A
roast I-A
pork I-A
. O

I O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
the O
whole O
subway O
ride O
hoping O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
table B-A
I O
can O
sit O
at O
by O
myself O
and O
not O
have O
to O
share O
with O
the O
rice B-A
congee I-A
soup I-A
people O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
best O
bagel B-A
in O
town O
. O

Everything O
a O
NY O
pizza O
joint O
should O
be O
. O

It O
was O
huge O
, O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
will O
be O
the O
reason O
we O
return O
. O

We O
go O
often O
. O

Light O
, O
refreshing O
summer B-A
rolls I-A
( O
not O
fried O
) O
remind O
me O
of O
Vietnamese O
places O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

moral O
stay O
away O
. O

but O
the O
service B-A
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

Spreads B-A
and O
toppings B-A
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
that O
their O
website O
had O
a O
link O
to O
da O
Ciro O
in O
Napoli O
, O
I O
knew O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
good O
pizza B-A
! O

No O
one O
asked O
what O
was O
wrong O
as O
we O
left O
with O
nothing O
touched O
on O
our O
plates B-A
. O

Indoor B-A
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

We O
had O
a O
3 O
hour O
brunch B-A
- O
they O
definitely O
do O
not O
rush O
you O
- O
and O
they O
kept O
the O
unlimited O
mimosas B-A
flowing O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

And O
their O
replacestart B-A
prices I-A
replaceend O
are O
very O
high O
- O
they O
actually O
think O
that O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
charging O
such O
replacestart B-A
prices I-A
replaceend O
for O
such O
terrible O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
! O

They O
' O
re O
terrific O
!! O

The O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
entire O
experience O
was O
very O
cool O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O
. O

Great O
spot B-A
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-A
or O
quiet O
dinner B-A
. O

Just O
stick O
with O
the O
small O
dishes B-A
! O

The O
cafe B-A
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
with O
comfortable O
outdoor B-A
chairs I-A
and O
tables B-A
, O
but O
the O
service B-A
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
rarely O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
slow O
staff B-A
in O
the O
10 O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
going O
. O

Food B-A
is O
excellent O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
literal O
hole O
- O
in O
- O
the O
- O
wall O
that O
is O
buried O
within O
Doyers O
, O
right O
off O
of O
Pell O
St O
( O
barber O
' O
s O
alley O
) O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

They O
outshine O
HH O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce B-A
and O
some O
walnuts B-A
the O
salads B-A
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

Excellent O
lunch B-A
buffet I-A
for O
only O
$ O
6 O
. O
95 O
. O

We O
were O
sorry O
to O
check O
them O
off O
our O
list O
as O
we O
had O
enjoyed O
and O
recommended O
the O
place O
in O
the O
past O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B-A
, O
you O
may O
encounter O
problems O
ordering O
here O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
bring O
plenty O
of O
cash O
with O
you O
as O
they O
don O
' O
t O
accept O
credit O
cards O
. O

both O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-A
( O
around O
$ O
8 O
for O
dinner B-A
and O
$ O
5 O
for O
lunch B-A
), O
and O
are O
delicious O
and O
filling O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune O
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

Ambience B-A
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

The O
portion B-A
sizes I-A
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-A
is O
good O
. O

Just O
wish O
they O
' O
d O
expand O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
ate O
tuna B-A
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
perfectly O
! O

This O
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
expected O
menu B-A
comprised O
only O
of O
pad B-A
thai I-A
and O
tom B-A
yum I-A
soup I-A
, O
but O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
what O
made O
the O
place O
so O
special O
. O

Good O
food B-A
at O
the O
restaurant O
( O
a O
bit O
expensive O
, O
but O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
your O
date O
). O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food B-A
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
there O
3 O
- O
4 O
times O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
always O
good O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait B-A
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
' O
s O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

great O
eats B-A
, O
good O
times O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Grilled O
whole O
fish B-A
wonderful O
, O
great O
spicing O
. O

For O
years O
, O
I O
thought O
Tuscan B-A
cuisine I-A
was O
the O
best O
, O
but O
Salvatore O
converted O
me O
to O
the O
hearty O
Neapolitan B-A
fare I-A
on O
my O
first O
visit O
. O

Plus O
, O
when O
our O
entrees B-A
were O
held O
up O
in O
the O
kitchen O
on O
a O
busy O
Saturday O
night O
, O
the O
owner B-A
sent O
over O
complimentary O
summer B-A
rolls I-A
to O
hold O
us O
over O
! O

The O
service B-A
was O
great O
as O
well O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-A
teriyaki I-A
and O
the O
rose B-A
special I-A
roll I-A
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
most O
of O
the O
entrees B-A
are O
approx O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
soon O
! O

Loved O
it O
! O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
relaxed O
, O
and O
we O
have O
now O
adopted O
Plate O
347 O
as O
our O
Secret O
on O
Second O
! O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
they O
were O
more O
than O
accomodating O
even O
though O
the O
place B-A
was O
packed O
. O

It O
is O
LOUD O
, O
HOT O
and O
DARK O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
, O
service B-A
and O
value B-A
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
I O
left O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
. O

I O
am O
a O
100 O
lb O
girl O
, O
had O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
and O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
beer I-A
prior O
to O
the O
dinner B-A
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
HUNGRY O
after O
my O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
! O

The O
drinks B-A
are O
a O
saving O
grace O
, O
but O
service B-A
staff I-A
, O
please O
, O
get O
over O
yourselves O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
' O
re O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B-A
guys I-A
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O
. O

The O
all O
- O
Italian O
staff B-A
is O
warm O
and O
engaging O
from O
the O
start O
. O

Village O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
scores O
on O
all O
fronts O
. O

The O
prices B-A
are O
exceptionally O
reasonable O
for O
food B-A
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
- O
your O
focus O
should O
be O
the O
Tamarind B-A
Margaritas I-A
. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
hidden O
spot O
there O
and O
I O
rave O
about O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

The O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
dish I-A
was O
superb O
! O

I O
had O
been O
a O
regular O
due O
to O
the O
consistently O
good O
food B-A
and O
ease O
of O
getting B-A
a I-A
table I-A
. O

Can O
' O
t O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
lie O
. O

great O
food B-A
, O
lt O
' O
s O
of O
it O
, O
more O
then O
one O
person O
can O
eat O
! O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
expect O
to O
like O
Nosh O
as O
much O
as O
I O
did O
, O
but O
the O
pastrami B-A
on I-A
challah I-A
sandwich I-A
I O
had O
was O
otherworldly O
, O
the O
soups B-A
are O
like O
Mom O
' O
s O
, O
and O
the O
knishes B-A
give O
Yonah O
Schimmel O
' O
s O
a O
run O
for O
its O
money O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-A
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables B-A
at O
most O
. O

This O
place O
is O
worth O
going O
even O
if O
only O
for O
their O
beer B-A
. O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B-A
and O
the O
mahi B-A
mahi I-A
( I-A
on I-A
saffron I-A
risotto I-A
- O
yum O
!). O

The O
ambience B-A
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-A
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-A
Go I-A
Hamburgers I-A
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

The O
sandwhiches B-A
are O
out O
- O
of O
- O
this O
world O
! O

If O
you O
live O
in O
Upper O
Manhattan O
, O
Siam O
Square O
is O
THE O
place O
for O
Thia B-A
food I-A
. O

Decor B-A
is O
charming O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
very O
well O
prepared O
. O

Really O
tasty O
spring B-A
rolls I-A
and O
noodles B-A
for O
a O
good O
price B-A
though O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

Good O
, O
because O
hey O
, O
it O
' O
s O
more O
food B-A
, O
but O
bad O
because O
dim B-A
sum I-A
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
smaller O
portions B-A
so O
you O
can O
try O
out O
more O
replacestart B-A
dish I-A
replaceendes I-A
and O
smaller O
so O
that O
each O
dish B-A
is O
cheap O
. O

While O
most O
people O
can O
attest O
to O
spending O
over O
$ O
50 O
on O
replacestart B-A
drinks I-A
replaceend O
in O
New O
York O
bars B-A
and O
hardly O
feeling O
a O
thing O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
drinks I-A
replaceend O
here O
are O
plentiful O
and O
unique O
. O

Complimentary O
stuff B-A
kept O
coming O
, O
and O
when O
the O
waiter B-A
saw O
me O
opening O
a O
gift O
, O
I O
received O
my O
dessert B-A
on O
a O
plate O
that O
had O
Happy O
Birthday O
written O
on O
it O
, O
with O
a O
candlevery O
nice O
touch O

and O
attentive O
staff B-A

The O
food B-A
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O

cold O
and O

INCREDIBLY O
POOR O
SERVICE B-A
AN O
FOOD B-A
QUALITY I-A
AT O
EXORBITANT O
PRICES B-A
. O

I O
have O
been O
about O
4 O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
meal B-A
. O

I O
go O
back O
in O
line B-A
like O
three O
times O
on O
average O
until O
I O
can O
' O
t O
walk O
anymore O
. O

We O
usually O
just O
get O
some O
of O
the O
dinner B-A
specials I-A
and O
they O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-A
and O
very O
tasty O
. O

Horrible O
food B-A
and O
Horrible O
service B-A
. O

The O

are O
plentiful O
and O
can O
' O

wait O
to O
try O
the O

Bleecker O
St O

the O
best O
! O

I O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
THE O
HEARTLAND O
BREWERY O
. O

They O
treated O
us O
well O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
extremely O
fresh O
and O
well O
- O
prepared O
. O

Their O
exotic B-A
salad I-A
is O
basic O
ly O
a O
delcious O
little O
green B-A
salad I-A
with O
a O
peanut B-A
sauce I-A
that O
is O
perfect O
before O

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
, O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
can O
' O
t O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B-A
is O
this O
friendly O
. O

The O
food B-A
came O
out O
wrong O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
and O
the O
wine B-A
showed O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-A
. O

The O
chicken B-A
and O
steak B-A
were O
seasoned O
and O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
and O
the O
lamb B-A
sandwhich I-A
is O
great O
for O
heartier O
appetites O
. O

Faan O
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

We O
saw O
them O
heating O
up O
at O
least O
one O
frozen O
item O
though O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B-A
sum I-A
dish I-A
it O
was O
. O

No O
you O
' O
re O
going O
to O
go O
back O
because O
the O
food B-A
was O
good O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
even O
better O
. O

While O
this O
can O
hardly O
be O
called O
a O
restaurant O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
Manhatten O
: O
$ O
4 O
for O
a O
plate O
heaped O
with O
rice B-A
and O
2 O
- O
3 O
entrees B-A
. O

Traditional B-A
French I-A
decour I-A
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-A
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

The O
fish B-A
is O
fresh O
and O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B-A
chef I-A
( O
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi B-A
and O
soy B-A
sauce I-A
but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B-A
salt I-A
). O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-A
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did O
' O
nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-A
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-A
( I-A
Egg I-A
) I-A
rolls I-A
. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
coming O
here O
at O
3am O
again O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-A
choices I-A
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
Thai O
place O
I O
go O
too O
in O
NYC O
, O
it O
' O
s O
wonderful O
, O
and O
live O
relaxed O
Jazz B-A
on O
certain O
nights O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
and O
ignored O
by O
waitstaff B-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
big O
group O
, O
this O
place O
is O
perfect O
because O
it O
recomends O
sharing O
- O
they O
have O
lazy B-A
susans I-A
on O
most O
tables B-A
- O
even O
families O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
here O
. O

They O
showed O
up O
15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
tuna B-A
melt O
. O

Tasty O
steak B-A
, O
pork B-A
loin I-A
, O
the O
works O
. O

I O
went O
with O
5 O
friends O
and O
we O
lingered O
at O
the O
table B-A
for O
a O
bit O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
feel O
rushed O
at O
all O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
wait B-A
. O

I O
went O
to O
Ruby O
Foos O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
enjoyed O
our O
experience O
there O
. O

I O
' O
d O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-A
and O
nice O
service B-A
. O

The O
burger B-A
was O
great O
, O
also O
. O

they O
did O
give O
a O
15 O
% O
discount B-A
at O
the O
end O
, O
wasn O
' O
t O
enough O
, O
as O
they O
knew O
the O
service B-A
was O
horrible O
. O

Just O
because O
it O
' O
s O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-A
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-A
is O
nasty O
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O
! O

The O
pizza B-A
was O
great O
. O

And O
everytime O
I O
go O
there O
' O
s O
a O
bunch O
of O
drunk O
idiots O
making O
a O
scene O
out O
front O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-A
pureed I-A
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
' O
ve O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
). O

however O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
service B-A
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

When O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
mention O
the O
specials B-A
, O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
. O

The O
price B-A
was O
extremely O
reasonable O
for O
the O
appetizers B-A
and O
food B-A
we O
ate O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-A
dishes I-A
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-A
- I-A
veg I-A
selections I-A
. O

Kenny O
the O
owner B-A
is O
always O
there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
. O

They O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
sushi O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B-A
is O
consistent O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
to O
wait B-A
only O
a O
few O
times O
during O
lunch B-A
but O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait B-A
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-A
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners B-A
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place O
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

Delicious O
food B-A
, O
excellent O
service B-A
, O
and O
a O
pretty O
atmosphere B-A
make O
this O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
dinner B-A
and O
the O
$ O
5 O
. O
99 O
replacestart B-A
lunch I-A
buffet O
replaceend O
makes O
it O
an O
even O
better O
choice O
for O
lunch B-A
! O

For O
appetizers B-A
, O
I O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B-A
fritters I-A
and O
dumplings B-A
. O

And O
cheap O
! O

Such O
nice O
people B-A
working O
here O
- O
but O
I O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
dark O
and O
not O
very O
attractive O
and O
then O
you O
have O
spot B-A
lights I-A
shining O
on O
you O
putting O
you O
in O
the O
worst O
light O
possible O
, O
reaching O
for O
sunglasses O
. O

Try O
the O
Times B-A
Square I-A
cocktail I-A
-- O
ginger B-A
lemonade I-A
with I-A
vodka I-A
( O
also O
available O
without O
vodka O
.) O

Nice O
find O
. O

Veal B-A
Parmigana I-A
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
' O
s O
! O

Great O
wine B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
mediocre O
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
air B-A
conditioning I-A
made O
for O
a O
less O
than O
comfortable O
meal B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
and O
staff B-A
always O
surprise O
me O
with O
the O
new O
heights O
they O
are O
taken O
to O
. O

Amazing O
! O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza B-A
( O
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
). O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
been O
seated O
propmtly O
. O

We O
try O
frequenting O
new O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
, O
but O
any O
time O
that O
we O
visit O
a O
restaurant O
other O
than O
Roth O
' O
s O
we O
are O
always O
disappointed O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
more O
pleasant O
than O
that O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
and O
would O
without O
a O
doubt O
come O
again O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-A
at O
a O
great O
price B-A
and O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
the O
decor B-A
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

What O
makes O
this O
restaurant O
special O
are O
the O
authentic O
sichuan B-A
cooking I-A
and O
being O
the O
only O
one O
in O
NYC O
that O
offers O
authentic O
chongqing B-A
hotpot I-A
. O

Mizu O
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O
. O

For O
sure O
i O
will O
keep O
coming O
back O
because O
i O
feel O
really O
this O
restaurant O
deserves O
. O

Our O
tiny O
table B-A
for O
two O
( O
dinner B-A
plates I-A
hung O
over O
edge O
) O
was O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
of O
the O
lanes O
of O
waiter B-A
traffic I-A
. O

Sake B-A
collection I-A
was O
excellent O
( O
Try O
Nanbu B-A
Bijin I-A
), O
but O
pricy O
. O

Interesting O
other O
dishes B-A
for O
a O
change O
include O
chicken B-A
in I-A
curry I-A
sauc I-A
replaceende I-A
and I-A
replacestart I-A
salmon I-A
caserole I-A
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorites O
though O
was O
the O
Angry B-A
Lobster I-A
, O
a O
cold B-A
lobster I-A
salad I-A
that O
was O
magnificent O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

Ask O
for O
Usha O
, O
the O
nicest O
bartender B-A
in O
manhattan O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
outstanding O
and O
my O
crab B-A
- I-A
cake I-A
eggs I-A
benedict I-A
could O
not O
have O
been O
better O
. O

The O
place O
' O
s O
decor B-A
and O
hidden O
bathrooms B-A
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

This O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
of O
the O
village O
. O

Its O
location B-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices B-A
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
again O
and O
again O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll O
and O
Hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

They O
treat O
me O
like O
family O
, O
morning O
and O
night O
. O

A O
wonderful O
place B-A
! O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place O
. O

Service B-A
was O
on O
par O
but O
not O
wonderful O
. O

for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

Deliveries B-A
often O
take O
up O
to O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
higher O
than O
most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
area O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Amma O
after O
a O
friend O
recommended O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
reviews O
and O
its O
nonsense O
that O
people O
are O
reviewing O
some O
places O
because O
it O
was O
too O
loud O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-A
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;-) O

We O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B-A
dogs I-A
thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O
is O
a O
whole O
section O
on O
the O
menu B-A
devoted O
to O
them O
. O

please O
don O
' O
t O
fool O
us O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
chicken B-A
with I-A
garlic I-A
sauce I-A
, O
chicken B-A
with I-A
black I-A
bean I-A
sauce I-A
, O
and O
hunan B-A
chicken I-A
. O

Because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O
crust B-A
, O
take B-A
- I-A
out I-A
pies I-A
get O
soggy O
in O
their O
boxes O
. O

I O
suspect O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what O
Rao O
' O
s O
would O
be O
if O
it O
hadn O
' O
t O
turned O
exclusive O
. O

The O
dish B-A
had O
like O
6 O
pieces O
of O
beef B-A
in O
it O
. O

strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
attorney O
next O
to O
you O
, O
or O
with O
the O
local O
union O
worker O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

We O
got O
in O
line O
and O
were O
served B-A
while O
in O
line O
a O
bannan B-A
fritter I-A
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
for O
my O
friend O
, O
which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O
rice B-A
and O
keeping O
water B-A
on O
hand O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

Appetizers B-A
are O
somewhere O
around O
$ O
7 O
each O
and O
the O
main B-A
dishes I-A
are O
between O
$ O
11 O
and O
$ O
16 O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Orsay O
for O
Valentine O
' O
s O
dinner B-A
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
about O
you O
guys O
, O
but O
when O
I O
go O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
I O
go O
for O
the O
food B-A
not O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-A
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone B-A
with I-A
chocolate I-A
chip I-A
replaceends I-A
- I-A
good I-A
but I-A
a I-A
far I-A
cry I-A
from I-A
what I-A
the I-A
name I-A
implies I-A
. I-A

A O
gentleman O
, O
maybe O
the O
manager B-A
, O
came O
to O
our O
table B-A
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O

If O

and O
the O
value B-A
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O

My O
family O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
last O
night O
for O
our O
annual O
Christmas B-A
dinner I-A
with O
the O
family O
members O
who O
would O
rather O
spend O
the O
holidays O
with O
friends O
out O
- O
of O
- O
town O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels B-A
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
booked O
solid O
and O
no O
other O
table B-A
was O
available O
. O

The O
restaraurant O
is O
very O
small O
so O
reservations B-A
are O
a O
must O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

A O
one O
women O
show O
! O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

At O
first O
i O
was O
rolling O
my O
ideas O
of O
yet O
another O
French O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
. O

To O
my O
right O
, O
the O
hostess B-A
stood O
over O
a O
busboy B-A
and O
hissed O
rapido O
, O
rapido O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
clear O
and O
re O
- O
set O
a O
table B-A
for O
six O
. O

In O
China O
the O
phrase O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
is O
hot O
and O
loud O
. O

After O
dealing O
with O
subpar O
pizza B-A
all O
over O
the O
Kensington O
neighborhood O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
found O
little O
toninos O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place O
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur B-A
rolls I-A
and O
white B-A
tuna I-A
sashimi I-A
. O

You O
won O
' O
t O
find O
that O
anywhere O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

I O
went O
here O
in O
the O
afternoon O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Our O
first O
greeting O
when O
we O
entered O
was O
The O
last O
call O
is O
at O
10 O
: O
15 O
. O

Interior O
was O
so O
so O
. O

I O
' O
m O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-A
. O

I O
guess O
the O
way O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
described O
it O
was O
The O
French O
Colonies O
. O

they O
were O
able O
to O
squeeze O
me O
in O
at O
6 O
after O
i O
called O
the O
night O
before O
my O
anniversary O
for O
a O
friday O
night O
reservation B-A
and O
told O
me O
they O
' O
d O
treat O
us O
well O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O

Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O
! O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

Note O
that O
they O
do O
not O
serve O
beer B-A
, O
you O
must O
bring O
your O
own O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
' O
s O
Sake O
bar B-A
because O
Haru O
' O
s O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

When O
we O
walked O
in O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
was O
there O
for O
200 O
years O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
typical O
short O
- O
order O
, O
dinner O
type O
. O

We O
shared O
a O
bottle B-A
of I-A
sake I-A
, O
an O
order O
of O
edamames B-A
, O
and O
she O
had O
the O
sushi B-A
plate I-A
while O
I O
had O
the O
sashimi B-A
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese B-A
sticks I-A
? O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

From O
the O
appetizers B-A
we O
ate O
, O
the O
dim B-A
sum I-A
and O
other O
variety O
of O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceends I-A
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
criticize O
the O
food B-A
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
6 O
: O
00 O
PM O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

Each O
table B-A
has O
a O
pot B-A
of I-A
boiling I-A
water I-A
sunken O
into O
its O
surface O
, O
and O
you O
get O
platters O
of O
thin O
sliced O
meats B-A
, O
various O
vegereplacestart O
table O
replaceends O
, O
and O
rice B-A
and O
glass B-A
noodles I-A
. O

I O
am O
going O
