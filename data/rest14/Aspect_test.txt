The O

I O
have O
to O
say O
they O
have O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-A
times I-A
in O
the O
city O
. O

Food B-A
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
hot O
- O
ready O
to O
eat O
! O

Did O
I O
mention O
that O
the O
coffee B-A
is O
OUTSTANDING O
? O

Certainly O
not O
the O
best O

however O
, O
it O
is O

and O
the O
place B-A
is O
very O
clean O
, O
sterile O
. O

I O
trust O
the O
people B-A
at O
Go O
Sushi O
, O
it O
never O
disappoints O

Straight O

very O
decent O
Japanese B-A
food I-A
. O

BEST O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A

, O
great O
asian B-A
salad I-A
. O

Try O
the O
rose B-A
roll I-A
( O
not O
on O
menu B-A
). O

I O
love O
the O
drinks B-A
, O
esp O
lychee B-A
martini I-A
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
also O
VERY O
good O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
Nicoise B-A
salad I-A
and O
was O
barely O
eatable O
. O

While O
there O
' O
s O
a O
decent O
menu B-A
, O
it O
shouldn O
' O
t O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks B-A
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert B-A
pizza I-A
. O

Once O
we O
sailed O
, O
the O
top O
- O
notch O
food B-A
and O
live B-A
entertainment I-A
sold O
us O
on O
a O
unforgettable O
evening O
. O

Our O
waiter B-A
was O
horrible O
; O
so O
rude O
and O
disinterested O
. O

The O
sangria B-A
' O
s O
- O
watered O
down O
. O

menu B-A
- O
uneventful O
, O
small O
. O

Anytime O
and O
everytime O
I O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Sushi O
Rose O
for O
fresh O
sushi B-A
and O
great O
portions B-A
all O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-A
. O

Great O
food B-A
but O
the O
service B-A
was O
dreadful O
! O

The O
portions B-A
of I-A
the I-A
food I-A
that O
came O
out O
were O
mediocre O
. O

the O
two O
waitress B-A
' I-A
s I-A
looked O
like O
they O
had O
been O
sucking O
on O
lemons O
. O

From O
the O
beginning O
, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
friendly O
staff B-A
memebers I-A
, O
and O
the O
convienent O
parking B-A
at O
Chelsea O
Piers O
made O
it O
easy O
for O
us O
to O
get O
to O
the O
boat O
. O

We O
enjoyed O
ourselves O
thoroughly O
and O
will O
be O
going O
back O
for O
the O
desserts B-A
.... O

Desserts B-A
are O
almost O
incredible O
: O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
their O
Tart B-A
of I-A
the I-A
Day I-A
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
at O
the O
lower O
reviews O
because O
it O
is O
definitely O
better O
than O
other O
places O
I O
have O
tried O
with O
higher O
ratings O
. O

Maybe O
the O
secret O
was O
that O
we O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
and O
everything O
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
extremely O
tasty O
, O
creatively O
presented O
and O
the O
wine B-A
excellent O
. O

WE O
ENDED O
UP O
IN O
LITTLE O
ITALY O
IN O
LATE O
AFTERNOON O
. O

WE O
WERE O
PLEASANTLY O
SURPRISED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

THE O
LASAGNA B-A
WAS O
PROBABLY O
THE O
BEST O
I O
HAVE O
TASTED O
. O

Harumi O
Sushi O
has O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
delicious O
array B-A
of I-A
sushi I-A
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
not O
just O
its O
superb O
cuisine B-A
, O
but O
also O
for O
its O
friendly O
owners B-A
and O
staff B-A
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
craving O
some O
serious O
indian B-A
food I-A
and O
desire O
a O
cozy O
ambiance B-A
, O
this O
is O
quite O
and O
exquisite O
choice O
. O

I O
definitely O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-A
as O
well O
. O

have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
here O
. O

It O
was O
pleasantly O
uncrowded O
, O
the O
service B-A
was O
delightful O
, O
the O
garden B-A
adorable O
, O
the O
food B-A
( O
from O
appetizers B-A
to O
entrees B-A
) O
was O
delectable O
. O

You O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
surprisingly O
good O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-A
is O
nice O
. O

How O
pretentious O
and O
inappropriate O
for O
MJ O
Grill O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
provides O
power O
lunch B-A
and O
dinners B-A
! O

Two O
wasted O
steaks B-A
-- O
what O
a O
crime O
! O

The O
staff B-A
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O
. O

I O
absolutely O
suggest O
this O
place O
. O

I O
think O
the O
meatball B-A
parm I-A
is O
good O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
tasting O
, O
well O
seasoned O
latin B-A
food I-A
eat O
at O
Cabana O
and O
you O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
. O

Definitely O
try O
the O
taglierini B-A
with I-A
truffles I-A
- O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
staff B-A
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
really O
personable O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
new O
restaurant O
that O
has O
been O
consistently O
good O
every O
time O
I O
have O
been O
. O

The O
gnocchi B-A
literally O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
! O

Had O
a O
great O
experience O
at O
Trio O
... O
staff B-A
was O
pleasant O
; O
food B-A
was O
tasty O
and O
large O
in O
portion B-A
size I-A
- O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
the O
portobello B-A
/ I-A
gorgonzola I-A
/ I-A
sausage I-A
appetizer I-A
and O
the O
lobster B-A
risotto I-A
. O

Entrees B-A
include O
classics O
like O
lasagna B-A
, O
fettuccine B-A
Alfredo I-A
and O
chicken B-A
parmigiana I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
the O
teriyaki B-A
I O
recommend O
. O

Meal B-A
was O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

Try O
the O
Peanut B-A
Butter I-A
Sorbet I-A
and O
the O
pizza B-A
with I-A
soy I-A
cheese I-A
! O

Good O
food B-A
at O
the O
right O
price B-A
, O
what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
. O

We O
love O
it O
, O
and O
took O
buses O
and O
cabs O
to O
get O
there O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
New O
York O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
top O
notch O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
attentive O
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
is O
great O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
on O
and O
off O
for O
the O
past O
five O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
La O
Lanterna O
has O
never O
, O
ever O
dissapointed O
me O
. O

Great O
food B-A
, O
great O
waitstaff B-A
, O
great O
atmosphere B-A
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
GREAT O
beer B-A
! O

this O
is O
still O
one O
of O
my O
most O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
area O
the O
food B-A
is O
inexpensive O
but O
very O
good O
( O
kimono B-A
shrimp I-A
special I-A
was O
excellent O
) O
and O
has O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-A
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
Nolita O
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
for O
as O
long O
as O
we O
have O
lived O
here O
, O
Peasant O
has O
been O
our O
favorite O
! O

The O
whole O
experience O
was O
satisfying O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
visit O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
interesting O
and O
quite O
reasonably O
priced B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
and O
clearly O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
were O
used O
. O

This O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
cooked O
fresh O
; O
it O
was O
obviously O
made O
before O
hand O
and O
then O
reheated O
. O

Appetizer B-A
are O
excellent O
here O
; O
you O
can O
make O
a O
great O
( O
and O
inexpensive O
) O
meal B-A
out O
of O
them O
. O

The O
spicy B-A
mussels I-A
are O
a O
highlight O
. O

Also O
get O
the O
Onion B-A
Rings I-A
-- O
best O
we O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Would O
not O
return O
for O
the O
amount O
we O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
being O
food B-A
replaceendies I-A
, I-A
we I-A
were I-A
utterly I-A
disappointed I-A
with I-A
the I-A
replacestart I-A
food I-A
. O

Huge O
portions B-A
, O
great O
and O
attentive O
service B-A
, O
and O
pretty O
good O
prices B-A
. O

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
their O
service B-A
and O
food B-A
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
waiter B-A
and O
then O
to O
the O
manager B-A
, O
but O
the O
intensity O
of O
rudeness O
from O
them O
just O
went O
up O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
the O
milkshakes B-A
are O
even O
better O
! O

Stay O
away O
if O
you O
' O
re O
claustrophobic O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
' O
hood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
in O
. O

the O
mushroom B-A
barley I-A
soup I-A
is O
amazing O
. O

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
I O
checked O
out O
Arezzo O
with O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
did O
as O
the O
food B-A
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff B-A
was O
friendly O
, O
courteous O
and O
efficient O
. O

Their O
duck B-A
here O
is O
also O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
come O
back O
to O
over O
the O
years O
. O

While O
it O
was O
large O
and O
a O
bit O
noisy O
, O
the O
drinks B-A
were O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
superb O
. O

One O
caveat O
: O
Some O
of O
the O
curried B-A
casseroles I-A
can O
be O
a O
trifle O
harsh O
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
impressed O
and O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
SPICEY O
???? O

The O
food B-A
was O
almost O
always O
EXCELLENT O
. O

I O
was O
pleasently O
surprised O
at O
the O
taste B-A
. O

A O
nice O
space B-A
, O
as O
long O
as O
it O
doesn O
' O
t O
get O
too O
crowded O
and O
a O
singleminded O
devotion O
to O
its O
chosen O
cuisine B-A
make O
Mare O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
seafood B-A
lovers O
. O

I O
never O
had O
an O
orange B-A
donut I-A
before O
so O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

they O
really O
provide O
a O
relaxing O
, O
laid O
- O
back O
atmosphere B-A
. O

This O
particular O
location O
certainly O
uses O
substandard O
meats B-A
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
resteraunt O
on O
my O
way O
home O
from O
the O
subway O
. O

The O
Management B-A
was O
less O
than O
accomodating O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
also O
more O
laid O
- O
back O
and O
relaxed O
. O

the O
teas B-A
are O
great O
and O
all O
the O
sweets B-A
are O
homemade O
. O

mojitos B-A
and O
the O
service B-A
are O
the O
best O
part O
in O
there O

Sandwiches B-A
, O
burgers B-A
and O
salads B-A
, O
like O
the O
lemon B-A
- I-A
dressed I-A
cobb I-A
, O
are O
classic O
successes O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
absolutely O
beautiful O
. O

The O
design B-A
is O
very O
intimate O
and O
romantic O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
wonderful O
and O
imaginative O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
very O
sharp O
and O
they O
look O
good O
too O
. O

The O
worst O
though O
was O
the O
taste B-A
. O

They O
were O
dry O
, O
stale O
and O
pretty O
flavorless O
. O

The O
fajita B-A
we O
tried O
was O
tasteless O
and O
burned O
and O
the O
mole B-A
sauce I-A
was O
way O
too O
sweet O
. O

Stay O
with O
the O
roasted B-A
chickens I-A
and O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
fine O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
warm O
, O
comfortable O
, O
artsy O
and O
sexy O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
( O
big O
selection B-A
, O
reasonable O
prices B-A
) O
and O
the O
drinks B-A
are O
really O
good O
. O

The O
steak B-A
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

The O
food B-A
did O
take O
a O
few O
extra O
minutes O
to O
come O
, O
but O
the O
cute O
waiters B-A
' O
jokes O
and O
friendliness O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B-A
. O

The O
selection B-A
of I-A
food I-A
is O
excellent O
( O
I O
' O
m O
not O
used O
to O
having O
much O
choice O
at O
restaurants O
), O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
is O
great O
. O

Only O
suggestion O
is O
that O
you O
skip O
the O
dessert B-A
, O
it O
was O
overpriced O
and O
fell O
short O
on O
taste B-A
. O

Food B-A
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
great O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
this O
restaurant O
is O
so O
often O
overlooked O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
in O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
perfect O
place O
. O

i O
dont O
know O
what O
some O
people O
who O
rave O
about O
this O
hot B-A
dog I-A
are O
talking O
about O
. O

it O
is O
a O
hidden O
delight O
complete O
with O
a O
quaint O
bar B-A
and O
good O
food B-A
. O

I O
find O
that O
most O
Kosher O
restaurants O
are O
average O
to O
good O
, O
but O
this O
has O
been O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
so O
far O
. O

The O
waiters B-A
ALWAYS O
look O
angry O
and O
even O
ignore O
their O
high O
- O
tipping O
regulars O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-A
is O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
a O
welcome O
escape O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
SI O
mall O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
' O
re O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
then O
typical O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
so O
is O
their O
food B-A
. O

Not O
terrible O
, O
but O
not O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
reviews O
of O
2002 O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
wraps B-A
, O
burgers B-A
and O
salads B-A
were O
all O
fresh O
, O
tasty O
and O
the O
mango B-A
margareta I-A
at O
$ O
9 O
was O
WELL O
WORTH O
the O
money O
. O

It O
was O
delicious O
and O
large O
! O

Anywhere O
else O
, O
the O
prices B-A
would O
be O
3x O
as O
high O
! O

The O
service B-A
we O
experienced O
was O
friendly O
and O
good O
. O

Our O
waiter B-A
was O
friendly O
and O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
didnt O
have O
a O
supportive O
staff B-A
to O
work O
with O
. O

The O
folding B-A
chair I-A
I O
was O
seated O
at O
was O
uncomfortable O
. O

As O
we O
waited O
I O
watched O
3 O
seperate O
groups O
of O
diners O
discuss O
how O
dissapointed O
they O
also O
were O
. O

An O
excellent O
choice O
in O
midtown O
. O

Service B-A
was O
among O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
fettucino B-A
alfredo I-A
was O
amazing O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
very O
good O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
so O
many O
vegan B-A
options I-A
. O

I O
know O
real O
Indian B-A
food I-A
and O
this O
wasn O
' O
t O
it O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
Smoked B-A
Trout I-A
... O
Lamb B-A
Chops I-A
, O
Veal B-A
Chops I-A
, O
Rabbit B-A
, O
the O
potato B-A
gratin I-A
, O
on O
and O
on O
and O
on O
... O

Even O
when O
the O
chef B-A
is O
not O
in O
the O
house O
, O
the O
food B-A

Everything O
from O
the O
eggs B-A

well O
and O
very O
tasty O
. O

The O
waiters B-A
were O
very O
professional O
, O
courteous O
and O
attentive O

My O

I O
went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
LOVED O

! O

The O
falafal B-A
was O
rather O
over O
cooked O
and O
dried O
but O
the O
chicken B-A
was O
fine O
. O

I O
highly O
reccomend O
the O
grand B-A
marnier I-A

me O
crazy O
! O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
was O
loud O
and O
inconsiderate O
. O

However O
, O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
and O
dramatically O
lacking O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
is O
cut O
in O
blocks O
bigger O
than O
my O
cell O
phone O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
great O
, O
my O
soup B-A
always O
arrives O
nice O
and O
hot O
. O

It O
had O
been O
awhile O

-- O
especially O
the O
silken O
creme B-A
brulee I-A
and O
paper O
- O
thin O
apple B-A
tart I-A
-- O
are O
good O
enough O
on O
their O
own O
to O
make O
the O
restaurant O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

My O
friend O
told O
me O
about O
this O
restaurant O
for O
a O
year O

Try O
the O
ribs B-A
, O
sizzling O
beef B-A
and O
couple O
it O
with O
coconut B-A
rice I-A

The O
only O
drawback O

that O
it O

a O
little O
pricey O
. O

Everything O

The O

very O
friendly O

I O
recently O
visited O
over O
this O
past O
summer O
after O
being O
away O
for O
a O
year O
. O

What O
a O
difference O
, O
the O
service B-A
was O
very O
comforting O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
better O
than O
average O
, O
but O
what O
really O
standed O
out O
was O
such O
a O
dynamic O
and O
extensive O
beer B-A
list I-A
. O

Frankly O
, O
the O
chinese B-A
food I-A
here O
is O
something O
I O
can O
make O
better O
at O
home O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
waiter B-A
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
upstairs O
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
scallops B-A
and O
asparagus B-A
and O
also O
had O
the O
soft B-A
shell I-A
crab I-A
as O
well O
as O
the O
cheese B-A
plate I-A
. O

Not O
to O
be O
overlooked O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
. O

this O
without O
question O
is O
one O
of O

the O
Garment O
district O
- O
far O
better O
than O
any O
restaurant O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
music B-A
which O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
too O
heavy O
for O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
and O
always O
informative O
without O
an O
air O
. O

The O
owner B-A
and O
staff B-A
go O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
. O

I O

The O

. O

The O
food B-A
was O
great O
- O
sushi B-A
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
cooked O
food B-A
amazed O
us O

For O
the O
price B-A
you O
pay O
for O
the O
food B-A
here O
, O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
at O
least O
on O
par O
with O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
. O

Food B-A
portion I-A
was O
SMALL O

ALL O

This O

everything O

scrumptious O
, O
from O
the O
excellent O
service B-A
by O
cute O

the O
extremely O
lush O

. O

It O
' O

traditional O

simple O

My O

The O
food B-A

all O

around O
good O
, O
with O
the O
rolls B-A
usually O
excellent O
and O
the O
sushi B-A
/ I-A
sashimi I-A
not O
quite O
on O
the O

level O
. O

( O
The O
sashimi B-A

My O

and O
I O
had O
a O
blast O

personally O
i O
say O

. O

In O
addition O
to O
great O
hot B-A
dogs I-A
, O
DOTP O
has O
wonderful O
breakfast B-A
sandwiches I-A
that O
feature O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
great O
things O
like O
tator B-A

and O
English B-A

, O
a O
delicious O
NJ O
- O
based O
pork B-A
product I-A
know O
to O
us O
Jersey O
girls O
and O
boys O
as O
Taylor B-A
ham I-A
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
name O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
happened O
because O
of O
a O
graceless O
manager B-A
and O
a O
rude O
bartender B-A
who O
had O
us O
waiting B-A
20 O
minutes O
for O
drinks B-A
, O
and O
then O
tells O
us O
to O
chill O
out O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
service B-A
great O
, O
but O
forming O
conversation O
around O
a O
table O
is O
so O
easy O
beacuse O
the O
atmosphere B-A
can O
be O
both O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O
. O

When O
the O
dish B-A
arrived O
it O
was O
blazing O
with O
green B-A
chillis I-A
, O
definitely O
not O
edible O
by O
a O
human O
. O

The O
absolute O
worst O
service B-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
experienced O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
below O
average O
( O
when O
they O
actually O
gave O
people O
the O
meals B-A
they O
ordered O
). O

It O
' O
s O
about O
$ O
7 O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
they O
have O
take B-A
- I-A
out I-A
or O
dine B-A
- I-A
in I-A
. O

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
BEST O
past O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
before O
attending O
an O
afternoon O
performance O
. O

Everything O
is O
very O
cheap O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
accompany O
your O
food B-A
with O
one O
of O
their O
fresh B-A
juice I-A
concoctions I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
reasonable O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
clean O
, O
and O
if O
you O
like O
soul B-A
food I-A
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-A
to O
be O
! O

You O
' O
ll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
eating O
there O
after O
church O
. O

I O
had O
roast B-A
chicken I-A
and O
a O
salad B-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
a O
regular O
customer O
at O
Juice O
Generation O
for O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
- O
my O
office O
moved O
to O
the O
Film O
Center O
on O
Ninth O
Avenue O
and O
they O
are O
on O
the O
next O
block O
. O

They O
have O
a O
very O
good O
chicken B-A
with I-A
avocado I-A
and O
good O
tuna B-A
as O
well O
. O

It O
' O
s O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
I O
like O
to O
support O
! O

But O
the O
meals B-A
were O
terrible O
. O

My O
chicken B-A
was O
completely O
dried O
out O
and O
on O
the O
cold O
side O
and O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
not O
very O
flavorful O
. O

Malted B-A
Milk I-A
Ball I-A
Gelato I-A
- O
have O
you O
ever O
in O
your O
life O
heard O
of O
anything O
so O
ridiculously O
wonderful O
? O

just O
walk O
by O
the O
window O
and O
see O
all O
the O
unbiased O
positive O
reviews O
in O
all O
the O
major O
nyc O
publications O
. O

Way O
too O
much O
money O
for O
such O
a O
terrible O
meal B-A
. O

Would O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
go O
. O

However O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
. O

A O
con O
was O
the O
slow O
bar B-A
service I-A
. O

Dessert B-A
was O
also O
to O
die O
for O
! O

BTW O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
very O
good O
. O

We O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
go O
back O
! O

I O
came O
again O
weeks O
later O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
again O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
experience O
. O

It O
' O
s O
eaten O
with O
black B-A
vinegar I-A
and O
shredded B-A
ginger I-A
. O

The O
unattractive O
lighting B-A
made O
me O
want O
to O
gag O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
overpriced O
, O
there O
was O
the O
most O
awful O
disco B-A
pop I-A
duo I-A
performing O
- O
and O
my O
escargot B-A
looked O
like O
it O
might O
crawl O
off O
the O
plate O
. O

We O
' O
ll O
definitly O
be O
back O
again O
! O

This O

The O

is O
always O
great O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-A
walks O
around O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
enjoy O

because O
the O
waiters B-A
need O
SEVERE O
ATTITUE O
ADJUSTMENTS O
. O

There O

the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
highly O
recommended O
. O

When O

the O
waiter B-A
gave O

a O
hard O
time O
, O

Do O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

since O
i O
was O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
made O
sure O
to O
give O
this O
a O
try O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
they O
are O
fantastic O
. O

Dieters O
stick O
to O
salads B-A
or O
indulge O
in O
vegetarian B-A
platters I-A
. O

So O
for O
a O
filling O
and O
healthy O
meal B-A
give O
it O
a O
go O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
imagine O
how O
much O
worse O
it O
would O
have O
been O
if O
we O
' O
d O
gone O
at O
a O
prime O
time O
! O

I O
have O
dined O
at O
Mammino O
several O
times O

and O
each O
time O
it O
gets O
bettter O
. O

Definitely O
something O
to O
come O
down O
and O
check O
out O
. O

Since O
I O
cook O
for O
a O
living O
, O
I O
' O
m O
very O
fussy O
about O
the O
food B-A
I O
eat O
in O
restaurants O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
outstanding O
. O

I O
went O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
stop O
here O
for O
pizza B-A
before O
hitting O
the O
Kips O
Bay O
movie O
theater O
. O

We O
always O
enjoy O
the O
pizza B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
few O
friends O
and O
will O
return O
. O

This O
place O
has O
been O
around O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Yum O
, O
the O
chicken B-A
is O
great O
here O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
!! O

You O
will O
find O
everything O
about O
Trio O
to O
your O
liking O
! O

This O
place O
was O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
ordered O
from O
here O
last O
week O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
' O
s O
located O
on O
86 O
street O
, O
right O
underneath O
the O
train O
station O
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
was O
great O
, O
a O
treat O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
. O

The O
host B-A
( I-A
owner I-A
) I-A
and O
servers B-A
are O
personable O
and O
caring O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
out O
this O
place O
after O
hearing O
about O
it O
in O
many O
magazines O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
everything O
... O
the O
food B-A
, O
the O
atmosphere B-A
... O
the O
incrediby O
kind O
and O
gracious O
hostess B-A
. O

Having O
moved O
I O
truly O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
great O
. O

I O
usually O
get O
one O
the O
Vietnamese B-A
Beef I-A
Noodle I-A
Soup I-A
. O

SUM O
IT O
: O
local O
investment O
bankers O
like O
it O
, O
try O
for O
yourself O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
started O
going O
to O
dosa O
hut O
more O
after O
that O
. O

We O
were O
wondering O
why O
they O
were O
there O
to O
make O
our O
dining B-A
experience I-A
miserable O
? O

Too O
bad O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Indian B-A
food I-A
in O
New O
York O
, O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
waiters B-A
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
if O
you O
frequent O
they O
will O
remember O
you O
. O

Intimate O
but O
charming O
interior B-A
with O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
service B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
as O
creative O
as O
the O
decor B-A
and O
both O
worked O
. O

Siam O
Square O
is O
fairly O
new O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
I O
think O
in O
time O
will O
gain O
the O
recognition O
it O
deserves O
. O

My O
first O
experience O
at O
Siam O
Square O
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

I O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
Siam O
Square O
many O
times O
since O
and O
everytime O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
overall O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
great O
, O
with O
a O
good O
selection B-A
, O
and O
everything O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
is O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

We O
had O
our O
Christmas O
party O
at O
Dos O
Caminos O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful O
. O

My O
personal O
favorite O
is O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
' O
s O
. O

The O
sauce B-A
is O
zesty O
and O
flavorful O
and O
the O
crust B-A
is O
nice O
and O
crispy O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
sushi B-A
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
an O
excellent O
selection B-A
( O
the O
rolls B-A
with I-A
crab I-A
are O
really O
great O
). O

Everyone O
who O
works O
there O
( O
the O
host B-A
, O
the O
bartender B-A
, O
the O
servers B-A
) O
is O
so O
helpful O
. O

And O
the O
food B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

Favourites O
include O
: O
potato B-A
spinach I-A
gnocchi I-A
and O
the O
lamb B-A
. O

Another O
great O
thing O
about O
Glechik O
- O
everything O
is O
very O
cheap O
! O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
chose O
this O
spot O
for O
lunch B-A
as O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
and O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
South O
St O
Seaport O
. O

But O
regulars O
know O
that O
the O
sandwiches B-A
are O
the O
real O
star O
here O
. O

The O
skillfully O
chosen O
Portuguese B-A
cheese I-A
cart I-A
paired O
with O
quality O
port B-A
provides O
the O
perfect O
Iberian O
ending O
. O

My O
friend O
had O
a O
burger B-A
and O
I O
had O
these O
wonderful O
blueberry B-A
pancakes I-A
. O

We O
were O
so O
happy O
with O
our O
food B-A
and O
were O
even O
more O
thrilled O
when O
we O
saw O
the O
bill B-A
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
place O
just O
isn O
' O
t O
ready O
for O
prime O
time O
. O

All O
toppings B-A
are O
so O
fresh O
you O
' O
d O
think O
they O
had O
their O
own O
vegetable O
garden O
and O
the O
crust B-A
is O
so O
perfect O
, O
that O
one O
actually O
thinks O
of O
how O
it O
was O
made O
. O

Quartino O
is O
my O
favoriate O
resturant O
in O
NYC O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
always O
gotten O
amazing O
service B-A
and O
we O
love O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
waitstaff B-A
is O
solicitous O
and O
friendly O
and O
always O
seems O
glad O
to O
see O
us O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
wonderful O
, O
if O
not O
stunningly O
creative O
. O

I O
' O
m O
in O
love O
with O
the O
lobster B-A
ravioli I-A
! O

My O
order O
is O
on O
my O
table O
even O
on O
a O
busy O
friday O
night O
within O
10 O
minutes O
( O
at O
the O
most O
) O
of O
hanging O
up O
the O
phone O
. O

We O
came O
across O
this O
restaurant O
by O
accident O
while O
at O
a O
DUMBO O
art O
festival O
and O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
our O
meal B-A
. O

Service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
no O
wait B-A
, O
and O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
price B-A
. O

I O
thought O
the O
food B-A
isn O
' O
t O
cheap O
at O
all O
compared O
to O
Chinatown O
. O

And O
you O
never O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
need O
to O
leave O
. O

Coffee B-A
is O
a O
better O
deal O
than O
overpriced O
Cosi B-A
sandwiches I-A
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
if O
we O
should O
order O
a O
drink B-A
or O
leave O
? O

great O
neighbhorhood O
spot O
. O

Bobb O
V O
' O
s O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
your O
Friends O
and O
Family O
! O

) O
It O
' O
s O
not O
the O
best O
Japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
a O
pretty O
solid O
one O
for O
its O
modest O
prices B-A
, O
and O
worth O
repeat O
visits O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
so O
good O
and O
so O
popular O
that O
waiting B-A
can O
really O
be O
a O
nightmare O
. O

Here O
' O
s O
the O
thing O
, O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
best O
city O
in O
the O
world O
for O
restaurants O
. O

Go O
spend O
your O
money O
somewhere O
that O
really O
wows O
you O
. O

The O
crowd O
was O
older O
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
cramped O
, O
but O
it O
has O
old O
school O
charm O
. O

This O
is O
a O
real O
gem O
of O
a O
place O
. O

I O
think O
this O
a O
a O
wonderful O
place O
. O

First O
walking O
in O
the O
place B-A
seemed O
to O
have O
great O
ambience B-A
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kitchenette O
this O
weekend O
for O
brunch B-A
. O

This O
place O
doesn O
' O
t O
get O
the O
publicity O
that O
Sylvias O
Soul O
Food O
restaurant O
does O
, O
but O
it O
should O
. O

Just O
because O
P O
Diddy O
had O
a O
party O
at O
Butter O
doesn O
' O
t O
mean O
we O
should O
be O
automatically O
impressed O
. O

Even O
for O
two O
very O
hungry O
people O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
food B-A
left O
to O
be O
taken O
home O
( O
it O
reheats O
really O
well O
also O
). O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
' O
s O
may O
not O
be O
everyone O
' O
s O
favorite O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
mine O
. O

The O
help O
was O
extremely O
nice O
and O
did O
not O
rush O
us O
. O

Then O
they O
somehow O
made O
a O
dry O
and O
burnt O
crust B-A
, O
around O
a O
raw O
and O
cold O
inside O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
good O
food B-A
, O
nothing O
more O
and O
that O
' O
s O
all O
we O
want O
! O

DON O
' O
T O
KNOW O
WHAT O
THE O
OTHERS O
ON O
THE O
BLOCK O
WERE O
LIKE O
BUT O
WE O
WERE O
PLEASED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

Average O
cake B-A
thats O
been O
courted O
by O
a O
LOT O
of O
hype O
. O

It O
' O
s O
cute O
and O
simple O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

My O

Everytime O

sure O

satified O
. O

Chef B-A
Waldy O

This O

Being O
a O
vegan O
myself O

good O
. O

Cantinetta O
is O
a O
real O
treasure O
in O
a O
see O
of O
mediocre O
Italian O
restaurants O
. O

The O
one O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
service B-A
was O
prompt O
, O
we O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
server B-A
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
staff B-A
greeted O
me O
warmly O
at O
the O
door O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
. O

Whether O
one O
pizza O
place O
is O
better O
than O
another O
is O
often O
very O
subjective O
. O

Really O
nice O
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
or O
on O
a O
date O
. O

Service B-A
is O
usually O
pretty O
good O
. O

Host B-A
and O
Host B-A
replaceendess I-A
was I-A
quite I-A
rude I-A
. I-A

You O
will O
not O
be O
missing O

I O
discovered O
Applebees O

is O
very O

rude O
or O
picky O
....... O
our O
meal B-A

great O
-. O

I O
recommend O
any O
of O
their O
salmon B-A
dishes I-A
...... O

The O
foie B-A
gras I-A
was O
sweet O
and O
luscious O
. O

The O
menu B-A
, O
which O
changes O
seasonally O
, O
shows O
both O
regional O
and O
international O
influences O
. O

but O
their O

was O
YUMMY O

everyone O
. O

jazz B-A
singer I-A

all O
get O
up O

. O

I O
often O
find O
myself O
with O
time O
to O
kill O
in O
Times O
Square O
, O
which O
is O
a O
shame O
since O
I O
don O
' O
t O

this O
area O
. O

They O
have O
very O
quick O
service B-A
which O
is O
great O
when O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
much O
time O

is O
average O
: O
breakfast O

soups B-A
, O
salads B-A

prices B-A
are O
way O
high O
for O
Brooklyn O
. O

This O
place O
is O
average O
... O
at O
best O
. O

the O
service B-A
is O
prompt O
friendly O
. O

Whatever O
the O
reason O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
place O
to O
be O
. O

This O
is O
literally O
a O
hot O
spot O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
downstairs B-A
bar I-A
scene I-A
is O
very O
cool O
and O
chill O
... O

The O
food B-A
was O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
when O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
just O
couldn O
' O
t O
justify O
it O
for O
the O
price B-A
( O
including O
2 O
drinks B-A
, O
$ O
100 O
/ O
person O
)... O

I O
' O
ve O
come O
here O
for O
casual B-A
lunches I-A
as O
well O
as O
for O
a O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
myself O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
Tequila B-A
fan O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Great O
beer B-A
selection I-A
too O
, O
something O
like O
50 O
beers B-A
. O

After O
reading O
the O
great O
reviews O
, O
I O
invited O
a O
die O
- O
hard O
downtown O
friend O
of O
mine O
to O
join O
me O
at O
TASTE O
. O

Not O
to O
sound O
too O
negative O
but O
be O
wary O
of O
the O
delivary B-A
. O

Feels O
like O
family O
when O
we O
go O
there O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
to O
be O
just O
as O
good O
as O
its O
owner B-A
, O
Da O
Silvano O
, O
just O
much O
less O
expensive O
. O

They O
have O
homemade B-A
pastas I-A
of O
all O
kinds O
-- O
I O
recommend O
the O
gnocchi B-A
-- O
yum O
! O

My O
vegetable B-A
risotto I-A
was O
burnt O
, O
and O
infused O
totally O
in O
a O
burnt O
flavor B-A
. O

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
! O

The O
main O
draw O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
price B-A
. O

How O
can O
hope O
to O
stay O
in O
business O
with O
service B-A
like O
this O
? O

But O
dinner B-A
here O
is O
never O
disappointing O
, O
even O
if O
the O
prices B-A
are O
a O
bit O
over O
the O
top O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
have O
amazing O
, O
sandwiches B-A
, O
soup B-A
, O
pizza B-A
etc O
, O
but O
their O
homemade B-A
sorbets I-A
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

the O
homemade B-A
Guacamole I-A
, O
the O
unbelievable O
entree B-A
, O
and O
thee O
most O
amazing O
deserts B-A
. O

The O
sushi B-A
is O
reasonably O
priced B-A
and O
fresh O
. O

It O
' O
s O
no O
- O
fuss O
, O
fast O
and O
delicious O
. O

Save O
room O
for O
deserts B-A
- O
they O
' O
re O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Best O
things O
to O
order O
are O
from O
the O
grill B-A
( O
Churrasco B-A
and O
Ribs B-A
). O

The O
traditional B-A
Italian I-A
items I-A
are O
great O
- O
cheap O
and O
served B-A
in O
a O
cozy O
setting B-A
. O

Whether O
your O
choose O
the O
iced B-A
blended I-A
mocha I-A
or O
the O
hot B-A
white I-A
mocha I-A
you O
are O
sure O
to O
be O
extremely O
happy O
. O

last O
Tuesday O
for O
a O
late B-A
lunch I-A
with O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
was O
delish O
and O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
feel O
bad O
eating O
it O
. O

Another O
friend O
had O
to O
ask O
3 O
times O
for O
parmesan B-A
cheese I-A
. O

Our O
waitress B-A
had O
apparently O
never O
tried O
any O
of O
the O
food B-A
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
recommend O
any O
wine B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
the O
portions B-A
are O
a O
bit O
small O
so O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

No O
doubt O
the O
next O
time O
we O
want O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
or O
are O
entertaining O
guests O
from O
out O
of O
town O
, O
Spirit O
and O
Bateaux O
will O
be O
our O
destination O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
Jewel O
Bako O
if O
you O
want O
to O
feel O
like O
you O
were O
kicked O
in O
the O
groin O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
too O
. O

The O
ambiance B-A
was O
pretty O
cool O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
hassle O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
lady O
next O
to O
us O
thought O
she O
had O
ordered O
a O
salad B-A
( O
including O
asking O
for O
salad B-A
dressing O
) O
and O
was O
instead O
given O
a O
quesedilla B-A
. O

El O
Nidos O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
which O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
, O
has O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
tasty O
, O
mouth O
watering O
pizza B-A
' I-A
s I-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
pretty O
poor O
all O
around O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
well O
below O
average O
relative O
to O
the O
cost B-A
, O
and O
outside O
there O
is O
a O
crazy O
bum O
who O
harasses O
every O
customer O
who O
leaves O
the O
place O
. O

Although O
I O
moved O
uptown O
I O
try O
to O
stop O
in O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
for O
the O
GREAT O
cheap O
food B-A
and O
to O
pay O
the O
friendly O
staff B-A
a O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
friend O
at O
the O
bar B-A
for O
a O
few O
minutes O

Chef B-A
Vincenzo O
, O
always O
there O
if O
you O
need O
him O
, O
is O
a O
real O
talent O
and O
a O
real O
Roman O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
to O
taste O
some O
great O
Indian B-A
food I-A
and O
want O
good O
service B-A
, O
definitely O
visit O
Curry O
Leaf O
. O

You O
must O
try O
Odessa B-A
stew I-A
or O
Rabbit B-A
stew I-A
; O
salads B-A
- O
all O
good O
; O
and O
kompot B-A
is O
soo O
refreshing O
during O
the O
hot O
summer O
day O
( O
they O
make O
it O
the O
way O
my O
mom O
does O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
home O
a O
lot O
). O

My O
daughter O
and O
I O
left O
feeling O
satisfied O
( O
not O
stuffed O
) O
and O
it O
felt O
good O
to O
know O
we O
had O
a O
healthy O
lunch B-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
almost O
tempted O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
bad O
review O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
crowds O
away O
... O
been O
going O
there O
on O
and O
off O
for O
a O
year O
now O
and O
it O
' O
s O
really O
my O
fave O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
city O
. O

When O
she O
complained O
, O
the O
waitress B-A
said O
, O
Sorry O
. O

The O
quality B-A
of I-A
the I-A
meat I-A
was O
on O
par O
with O
your O
local O
grocery O
store O
. O

They O
specialize O
in O
smoothies B-A
and O
fresh B-A
juices I-A
. O

It O
first O
came O
well O
done O
, O
and O
I O
politely O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
black B-A
roasted I-A
codfish I-A
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
dish B-A
of O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
manager B-A
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu B-A
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed O
with O
the O
waiter B-A
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O
. O

In O
mi O
burrito O
, O
here O
was O
nothing O
but O
dark O
chicken B-A
that O
had O
that O
cooked O
last O
week O
and O
just O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave O
taste B-A
. O

during O
busy O
hrs O
, O
i O
recommend O
that O
you O
make O
a O
reservation B-A
. O

Don O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
time O
or O
your O
money O
. O

it O
' O
s O
good O
but O
, O
like O
the O
movie O
is O
never O
as O
good O
as O
the O
book O
, O
this O
is O
same O
analogy O
. O

it O
was O
a O
very O
warm O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Common O
Stock O
for O
brunch B-A
and O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
. O

now O
called O
nikki O
sushi B-A
, O
sushi B-A
is O
OK O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
also O
outstanding O
and O
is O
served B-A
quite O
quickly O
. O

I O
just O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place O
that O
is O
negative O
except O
that O
it O
' O
s O
not O
a O
cheap O
night O
out O
... O
but O
it O
' O
s O
SO O
worth O
it O
. O

From O
the O
erbazzone B-A
emiliana I-A
to O
the O
mostarda B-A
on I-A
the I-A
cheese I-A
plate I-A
, O
the O
dishes B-A
at O
this O
restaurant O
are O
all O
handled O
with O
delicate O
care O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
bar B-A
has O
a O
great O
vibe B-A
. O

expectations O
were O
real O
hi O
reading O
the O
' O
10 O
' O
s O
'. O

There O
' O
s O
candlelight B-A
and O
music B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
nice O
to O
find O
a O
place O
that O
is O
open O
24 O
hours O
( O
especially O
in O
downtown O
Brooklyn O
). O

Simple O
healthy O
unglamorous O
food B-A
cheap O
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
fantastic O
dining B-A
experience I-A
, O
that O
I O
returned O
again O
the O
same O
week O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
the O
food B-A
still O
is O
good O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
quick O
and O
attentative O
even O
though O
its O
usually O
very O
busy O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
absolutely O
adorable O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Chicken B-A
Teriyaki I-A
and O
my O
husband O
got O
Garlic B-A
Shrimp I-A
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
Japanese B-A
food I-A
at O
a O
mall O
food O
court O
. O

The O
staff B-A
members I-A
are O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
even O
replaced O
my O
drink B-A
once O
when O
I O
dropped O
it O
outside O
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-A
but O
such O
a O
let O
down O
. O

The O
Sashimi B-A
portion I-A
are O
big O
enough O
to O
appease O
most O
people O
, O
but O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
the O
fact O
they O
used O
artifical B-A
lobster I-A
meat I-A
. O

They O
have O
wheat B-A
crusted I-A
pizza I-A
made O
with O
really O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
ingredients B-A
. O

Had O
a O
lovely O
dinner B-A
in O
this O
dedicated O
seareplacestart O
food O
replaceend O
joint O
, O
food B-A
was O
well O
- O
prepared O
and O
- O
presented O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
pleasant O
and O
prompt O
. O

the O
icing O
MADE O
this O
cake B-A
, O
it O
was O
fluffy O
, O
not O
ultra O
sweet O
, O
creamy O
and O
light O
. O

Finally O
let O
into O
the O
store O
5 O
at O
a O
time O
, O
to O
buy O
expensive O
slices B-A
from O
a O
harried O
staff B-A
. O

We O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
just O
leave O
because O
we O
were O
essentially O
being O
ignored O
by O
the O
wait B-A
staff I-A
-- O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
largely O
empty O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
extensive O
, O
well O
priced B-A
and O
covers O
alot O
of O
regions O
. O

Go O
here O
if O
you O
want O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
salads B-A
of O
any O
type O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
is O
adorable O
- O
even O
the O
bathroom B-A
! O

Speedy O
delivers B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
, O
decent O
prices B-A
, O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
combine O
to O
ensure O
an O
enjoyable O
repast B-A
. O

THEY O
HAVE O
WAITERS B-A
ON O
THE O
SIDEWALK O
TRYING O
TO O
PULL O
YOU O
IN O
WHICH O
MADE O
US O
SUSPICIOUS O
. O

IT O
WAS O
OUR O
ONLY O
OPPORTUNITY O
TO O
VISIT O
AND O
WANTED O
AN O
AUTHENTIC O
ITALIAN B-A
MEAL I-A
. O

It O
took O
100 O
years O
for O
Parisi O
to O
get O
around O
to O
making O
pizza B-A
( O
at O
least O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O
year O
)... O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
simple O
medium O
rare O
steak B-A
. O

Generously O
garnished O
, O
organic B-A
grilled I-A
burgers I-A
are O
the O
most O
popular O
dish B-A
, O
but O
the O
Jerusalem B-A
market I-A
- I-A
style I-A
falafel I-A
wraps I-A
and O
Mediterranean B-A
salads I-A
-- I-A
layered I-A
with I-A
beets I-A
, I-A
goat I-A
cheese I-A
and I-A
walnuts I-A
-- O
are O
equally O
scrumptious O
. O

Probably O
my O
worst O
dining B-A
experience I-A
in O
new O
york O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
former O
waiter B-A
so O
I O
know O
what O
I O
' O
m O
talking O
about O
. O

Result O
( O
red O
velvet O
): O
Great O
texture B-A
, O
soft O
and O
velvety O
, O
nice O
hint B-A
of I-A
cocoa I-A
. O

Ask O
for O
the O
round B-A
corner I-A
table I-A
next I-A
to I-A
the I-A
large I-A
window I-A
. O

Their O
twist B-A
on I-A
pizza I-A
is O
heatlhy O
, O
but O
full O
of O
flavor B-A
. O

The O
lack O
of O
AC B-A
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
a O
million O
swarming O
bodies O
( O
although O
everyone O
is O
polite O
and O
no O
one O
is O
pushing O
) O
is O
a O
slight O
turn O
off O
. O

I O
love O
the O
Little O
Pie O
Company O
as O
much O
as O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
written O
reviews O
, O
but O
must O
discourage O
anyone O
from O
visiting O
the O
Grand O
Central O
location O
due O
to O
their O
RUDE O
service B-A
from O
two O
sales B-A
people I-A
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
unless O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
in O
a O
convenient O
location B-A
but O
is O
more O
like O
a O
hidden O
treasure O
. O

Didn O
' O
t O
seem O
like O
any O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
the O
display B-A
and I-A
quality I-A
of I-A
the I-A
food I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
-- O
though O
mostly O
deep O
- O
fried O
-- O
is O
simple O
and O
satisfying O
. O

We O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
have O
been O
going O
there O
twice O
a O
week O
since O
the O
day O
they O
first O
opened O
. O

Glechik O
might O
be O
way O
too O
tiny O
for O
a O
restaurant O
by O
Russian O
standards O
, O
but O
it O
is O
cozy O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
simply O
GREAT O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
- O
authentic O
Italian B-A
cuisine I-A
made O
absolutely O
fresh O

At O
night O
the O

I O

!! O

new B-A
hamburger I-A

Perfectly O

I O
can O
understand O
the O
prices B-A
if O
it O
served O
better O
food B-A
, O
like O
some O
Chinese O
restaurants O
in O
midtown O
/ O
uptown O
area O
. O

Service B-A
was O
awful O
- O
mostly O
because O
staff B-A
were O
overwhelmed O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

To O
the O

and O
the O

simply O

. O

This O
little O
place B-A

wonderfully O
warm O

perfect O
for O
a O

Has O
the O

of O
a O

yet O
it O
is O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
watch O

The O
service B-A
was O
great O
, O
and O
they O
have O
a O
whole O
great O
deal O
for O
birthdays O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
100 O
% O
Italian O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
as O
authentic O
as O
it O
gets O

My O
only O
complaint O

be O
the O
fortune B-A

I O
' O

Have O
a O
mojito B-A

The O
service B-A
was O
dreadfully O
slow O
( O
the O
place O
was O
only O
half O
full O
) O
and O
a O
smile O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
... O

I O
went O
this O
past O
Saturday O
and O
had O
a O
excellent O
meal B-A
of O
consisting O
of O
a O
braised B-A
lamb I-A
shank I-A
with I-A
mashed I-A
potatoes I-A
. O

The O
waitress B-A
came O
by O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
soy B-A
sauce I-A
WHILE O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
lunch B-A
!!!!! O

So O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-A
, O
the O
bar B-A
replaceendtender I-A
didn I-A
' I-A
t I-A
seem I-A
like I-A
he I-A
wanted I-A
to I-A
be I-A
there I-A
. I-A

I O
reccomend O
the O
fried B-A
pork I-A
dumplings I-A
, O
the O
orange B-A
chicken I-A
/ I-A
beef I-A
, O
and O

You O
will O
not O
be O
dissapointed O
by O
any O
of O
the O
choices O
in O
the O
menu B-A
. O

The O
french B-A
fries I-A
-- I-A
with I-A
the I-A
kalmata I-A
dip I-A
were O
terrific O
! O

Would O
you O
ever O
believe O
that O
when O
you O
complain O
about O
over O
an O
hour O
wait B-A
, O
when O
they O
tell O
you O
it O
will O
be O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
, O
the O
manager B-A
tells O
the O
bartender B-A
to O
spill O
the O
drinks B-A
you O
just O
paid O
for O
? O

The O
boutique B-A
selection I-A
of I-A
wines I-A
covers O
a O
wide O
variety O
without O
being O
imposeing O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
lucky O
and O
there O
' O
s O
not O
a O
private O
party O
going O
on O
back O
there O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
chill O
out O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great O
assortment B-A
of I-A
wraps I-A
if O
your O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
traditional B-A
Mediterranean I-A
fare I-A
. O

Fresh B-A
veggies I-A
, O
all O
sorts O
of O
middle B-A
eastern I-A

soooo O
much O
fooood B-A
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
delicious O
. O

Disappointingly O
, O
their O
wonderful O
Saketini B-A
has O
been O
taken O
off O
the O
bar B-A
menu I-A
. O

In O
Short O
The O
Black O
Sheep O
distinguishes O
itself O
from O
the O
Midtown O
pub O
herd O
with O
a O
look B-A
that O
' O
s O
a O
mix O
of O
sports O
- O
bar O
butch O
and O
ornate O
kitsch O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
-- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B-A
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

They O
are O
located O
off O
the O
beaten O
path O
but O
are O
certainly O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

then O
she O
made O
a O
fuss O
about O
not O
being O
able O
to O
add O
1 O
or O
2 O
chairs B-A
on O
either O
end O
of O
the O
table B-A
for O
additional O
people O
. O

The O
happy B-A
hour I-A
is O
so O
cheap O
, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
service B-A
or O
the O
atmosphere B-A
. O

After O
waiting B-A
for O
almost O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
brusquely O
told O
us O
he O
' O
d O
forgotten O
to O
give O
the O
kitchen B-A
our O
order O
. O

With O
all O
the O
mundane O
or O
mediocre O
places O
on O
8th O
avenue O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
one O
that O
is O
a O
step O
above O
in O
quaility B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
. O

A O
mix O
of O
students O
and O
area O
residents O
crowd O
into O
this O
narrow O
, O
barely O
there O
space B-A
for O
its O
quick O
, O
tasty O
treats B-A
at O
dirt O
- O
cheap O
prices B-A
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
, O
menu B-A
is O
typical O
French O
but O
varied O
. O

It O
gets O
crowded O
at O
lunchtime O
but O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
seats B-A
in O
back O
and O
everyone O
who O
works O
there O
is O
so O
nice O
. O

but O
for O
the O
value B-A
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
affordable O
spot O
to O
enjoy O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
with O
small O
group O
. O

the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
city O
search O
are O
probably O
from O
jealous O
competing O
restaurants O
who O
realize O
they O
can O
' O
t O
compete O
with O
Temple O
' O
s O
entire O
positive O
attitude B-A
about O
the O
proper O
way O
to O
treat O
their O
customers O
and O
deliver O
top O
quality O
food B-A
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
and O
were O
finished O
eating O
and O
paying O
before O
the O
wine O
came O
. O

It O
was O
good O
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
flavors B-A
WOW O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-A
to O
take O
a O
few O
friends O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
. O

Food B-A
is O
excellent O
quality O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
price B-A
. O

Actually O
, O
everyone O
who O
worked O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
annoyed O
. O

for O
about O
eleven O
bucks O
you O
get O
a O
gigantic O
burrito B-A
( O
or O
tacos B-A
), O
margarita B-A
, O
and O
dessert B-A
. O

The O
space B-A
is O
traditional O
in O
feel O
. O

the O
restaurant O
was O
completely O
empty O
, O
but O
she O
gave O
me O
a O
dirty O
look O
and O
asked O
, O
no O
reservations B-A
? O

the O
food B-A
was O
mediocre O
to O
be O
kind O
- O
the O
interior B-A
is O
small O
and O
average O
- O
the O
owners B-A
are O
a O
tag O
- O
team O
of O
unpleasantries O
- O
so O
rude O
and O
snotty O
i O
actually O
let O
out O
a O
hearty O
guffaw O
whilst O
dining B-A
. O

Good O
service B-A
, O
great O

and O
never O

to O
wait B-A

the O

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years O
, O
in O
the O
past O
the O
service B-A
was O
average O
and O
the O
food B-A
inconsistant O
. O

The O
music B-A
was O
fascinating O
, O
but O
left O
room O
for O
conversation O
, O
and O
the O
bartender B-A
made O
superb O
drinks B-A

the O
service B-A
is O
always O
wonderful O
and O
the O
prices B-A
are O
really O
reasonable O
. O

Not O
because O
I O
was O
pregnant O

but O
the O
food B-A

always O
delicious O
. O

Had O
a O
great O
meal B-A
there O
this O
weekend O
before O

! O

We O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
here O
recently O
and O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
was O
amazing O
. O

the O
dinner B-A
menu I-A
offers O
a O
variety O
of O
great O
entrees B-A
, O
including O
fresh O
seafood B-A
and O
huge O
steaks B-A
, O
there O
' O
s O
also O
a O
couple O
of O
non B-A
- I-A
meat I-A
alternatives I-A
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
strangest O
menu B-A
and O
the O
restaurants O
tries O
too O
hard O
to O
make O
fancy O
food B-A
. O

The O
appetizers B-A
are O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-A
is O
slow O
. O

the O
food B-A
- O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-A
. O

What O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
place O
where O
the O
waitress B-A
brings O
out O
the O
wrong O
entree B-A
, O
then O
verbally O
assaults O
your O
80 O
year O
old O
grandmother O
and O
gives O
her O
lip O
about O
sending O
it O
back O
( O
which O
she O
did O
politely O
, O
by O
the O
way O
). O

The O
prices B-A
are O
not O
terrible O
. O

15 O
% O
gratuity B-A
automatically O
added O

The O
halibut B-A
cheek I-A
appetizer I-A
came O
with O
a O
generous O
portion B-A
of I-A
foie I-A
gras I-A
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal B-A
. O

Food B-A
is O
excellent O
and O
they O
also O
have O
empenadas B-A
and O
plaintains B-A
which O
are O
good O
for O
an O
afternoon B-A
snack I-A
. O

Both O
a O
number O
of O
the O
appetizer B-A
and O
pasta B-A
specials I-A
were O
amazing O
. O

All O

. O

Although O
somewhat O
loud O
, O
the O
noise B-A
was O
minimally O
intrusive O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
basic O
pizza B-A
joint O
, O
not O
much O
to O
look O
at O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-A
is O
what O
I O
go O
for O
. O

Tables B-A
are O
close O
, O
so O
you O
better O
be O
comfortable O
bumping O
elbows O
with O
other O
patrons O

. O

Dug O
the O
blue B-A
bar I-A
area I-A
too O
. O

We O
spent O
so O
much O
time O
getting O
elbowed O
around O
while O
we O
waited O
we O
left O
. O

I O
got O
the O
opportunity O
to O
dine O
at O
your O
establishment O
again O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
in O
your O
upstrairs B-A
dining I-A
area I-A
. O

Meat O
- O
phobes O
are O
in O
luck O
with O
the O
extraordinary O
veggie B-A
burger I-A
, O
made O
from O
a O
distinctive O
blend O
of O
chickpeas B-A
, O
carrots B-A
and O
other O
vegetables B-A
and O
spices B-A
. O

At O
peak O
times O
, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overcrowded O
and O
tables B-A
are O
uncomfortably O
close O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
on O
point O
- O
what O
else O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
Ritz O
? O

Menus B-A
feature O
seasonal O
picks O
, O
like O
sweet B-A
corn I-A
- I-A
foie I-A
gras I-A
brulee I-A
. O

Innovations O
are O
just O
as O
assured O
, O
from O
the O
simple O
Carinthia B-A
cheese I-A
ravioli I-A
with I-A
wild I-A
mushrooms I-A
to O
the O
caviar B-A
- I-A
topped I-A
sturgeon I-A
, O
beautifully O
matched O
with O
a O
bright O
green B-A
spinach I-A
- I-A
vodka I-A
sauce I-A
. O

And O
these O
are O
not O
small O
, O
wimpy O
fast O
food O
type O
burgers B-A
- O
these O
are O
real O
, O
full O
sized O
patties B-A
. O

There O
restaurant O
is O
very O
casual O
, O
but O
perfect O
for O
lunch B-A
, O
and O
their O
delivery B-A
service I-A
is O
always O
very O
fast O
. O

Chinatown O
definitely O
has O
better O
quality B-A
with O
cheaper O
prices B-A
. O

I O
had O
to O
flag O
down O
a O
third O

... O
so O
now O
it O

NYC O
for O
over O
10 O
years O

could O
not O
find O
this O
delicacy O
east O

the O
Hudson O
. O

Go O
with O
the O
specials B-A
, O
and O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
salmon B-A
. O

The O
pastas B-A
were O
pretty O
good O
. O

Atmosphere B-A
is O
a O
bore O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
what O
initially O
got O
me O

The O

the O

. O

Service B-A
was O
good O
and O

was O
the O
atmosphere B-A
. O

MY O
date O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Branzini B-A
and O
both O
felt O
the O
fish B-A
was O
very O
average O
. O

We O
were O
there O
March O
7 O
and O
found O
Maison O
very O

. O

The O
food B-A

, O
the O

prompt O
, O
and O
the O

and O
an O
excellent O
host B-A
. O

went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
my O
coworker O
. O

Pizzas B-A
were O
excellent O
in O
addition O
to O
appetizers B-A
and O
main B-A
courses I-A
. O

Definitely O
try O
the O
calamari B-A
, O
any O
pasta B-A
, O
or O
even O
the O
Sliced B-A
steak I-A
entree I-A
. O

The O
caeser B-A
salad I-A
was O
great O
. O

The O
fried B-A
calamari I-A
was O
even O
better O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-A
was O
nice O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
dark O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
overall O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
tops O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
very O
large O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
fantastic O
!! O

I O
recomend O
the O
chicken B-A

. O

excellent O
tapas B-A
at O
great O
prices B-A
, O
romantic O
, O
small O
but O
not O
overly O
crowed O
, O
excellent O

The O
service B-A
is O
a O
quite O
slow O
, O
but O
friendly O
. O

The O
chocolate B-A
raspberry I-A
cake I-A
is O
heavenly O
- O
not O
too O
sweet O
, O
but O
full O
of O
flavor B-A
. O

Our O
waiter B-A
was O
helpful O
and O
charming O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
perfect O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-A
was O
good O
, O
too O
. O

I O

)@ O
PIGALLE O

Best O
hot B-A

This O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
an O
establishment O
in O
which O
its O
owners O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
restaurant O
business O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
MEET O
at O
all O
, O
it O
is O
a O
rip O
off O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
time O
to O
step O
in O
! O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
special O
celebration O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quiet O
and O
intimate O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
generous O
. O

We O
had O
tons O
of O
great O
food B-A
, O
wine B-A
, O
and O
desserts B-A
. O

Really O
Lovely O
dining B-A
experience I-A
in O
the O
midst O
of O
buzzing O
midtown O
area O
. O

OK O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Dumont O
a O
few O
times O
now O
. O

The O
food B-A
really O
isn O
' O
t O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
terrible O
. O

Maybe O
it O
' O
s O
that O
most O
of O
Dumont O
' O
s O
patrons O
are O
younger O
and O
have O
lower O
expectations O
, O
but O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
Dumont O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
have O
the O
best O
escargot B-A
in O
town O
, O
they O
always O
try O
to O
accomodate O
our O
toddler O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Sotto O
Voce O
several O
time O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
one O
place O
that O
hits O
the O
nail O
right O
on O
the O
head O
ever O
time O
! O

Between O
my O
guest O
and O
I O
, O
we O
sampled O
at O
least O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
menu B-A
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
hits O
. O

The O
Deco B-A
and O
ambiance B-A
was O
really O
romantic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
unknown O
restaurant O
in O
and O
around O
New O
York O
. O

Just O
go O
in O
and O
sample O
the O
greatest O

For O
someone O
who O
used O
to O
hate O
Indian B-A
food I-A
, O
Baluchi O
' O
s O
has O
changed O
my O
mid O

Finally O
a O
curry B-A

not O
suffer O
from O

I O
went O

menu I-A

Not O
only O
was O
the O
waiter B-A
efficient O
and O
courteous O
, O
but O
also O
extremely O
helpful O
. O

It O
took O
a O
bigger O
bite O
from O
my O
wallet O
than O
my O
appetite O
- O
I O
would O
not O
reccomend O
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
I O
would O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
again O
!! O

This O
place B-A
is O
classy O
, O
chic O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
warm O
and O
hospitable O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O

I O

. O

It O
' O

a O
great O
find O
in O
Astoria O

Great O
burgers B-A

The O

Sushi B-A
so O
fresh O
that O
it O
crunches O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

But O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
room O
on O
your O
credit O
card O
as O
the O
bill B-A
will O
leave O
a O
big O
dent O
in O
your O
wallet O
. O

Despite O
the O
5th O
ave O
address O
there O
are O
no O
frills O
whick O
I O
also O
love O
. O

They O
bring O
a O
sauce B-A
cart I-A
up O
to O
your O
table B-A
and O
offer O
you O
up O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
choices B-A
of I-A
sauces I-A
for O
your O
steak B-A
( O
I O
tried O
them O
ALL O
). O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
sushi B-A
fresh O
, O
they O
also O
served O
other O
entrees B-A
allowed O
each O
guest O
something O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
we O
all O
left O
happy O
( O
try O
the O
duck B-A
! O

good O
variety B-A
but O
nothing O
surprising O
. O

After O
I O
paid O
for O
my O
purchase O
, O
I O
noticed O
they O
had O
not O
given O
me O
utensils B-A
so O
I O
could O
eat O
my O
pie B-A
. O

Likewise O
if O
you O
like O
really O
thin B-A
crust I-A
or O
really O
big O
slices B-A
then O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
' O
s O
may O
not O
be O
your O
favorite O
. O

It O
' O
s O
always O
quiet O
because O
it O
' O
s O
awful O
. O

No O
green B-A
beans I-A
, O
no O
egg B-A
, O
no O
anchovy B-A
dressing I-A
, O
no O
nicoise B-A
olives I-A
, O
no O
red B-A
onion I-A
. O

Build O
a O
meal B-A
with O
side B-A
orders I-A
like O
Amazin B-A
' I-A
Greens I-A
salads I-A
, O
Buffalo B-A
Chicken I-A
Kickers I-A
and O
Cinna B-A
Stix I-A
. O

Thick O
fries B-A
, O
meaty B-A
chili I-A
and O
stuffed B-A
baked I-A
potatoes I-A
round O
out O
a O
menu B-A
that O
includes O
a O
cool O
, O
ultra O
- O
thick O
chocolate B-A
Frosty I-A
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter B-A
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B-A
. O

Good O
replacestart B-A
cake I-A
replaceend O
BUT O
: O
it O
was O
not O
the O
best O
replacestart B-A
cake I-A
replaceend O
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
definately O
not O
worth O
standing O
outside O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
being O
herded O
like O
cattle O
by O
indifferent O
and O
overworked O
employees B-A
. O

The O
closest O
that O
I O
got O
was O
the O
Cherry B-A
Marscapone I-A
, O
but O
they O
were O
out O
of O
it O
that O
day O
. O

The O
homage O
to O
India O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
delectable O
roti B-A
canai I-A
appetizer I-A
, O
a O
fried B-A
pancake I-A
served I-A
with I-A
pungent I-A
curry I-A
dipping I-A
sauce I-A
, O
while O
the O
mango B-A
chicken I-A
offers O
a O
surprisingly O
sophisticated O
, O
fresh O
take O
on O
sweet O
- O
and O
- O
sour O
. O

It O
doesn O
' O
t O
look O
like O
much O
on O
the O
outside B-A
, O
but O
the O
minute O
you O
walk O
inside O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
whole O
other O
atmosphere B-A
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
place O
was O
awesome O
. O

The O
ground B-A
chickpea I-A
soup I-A
we O
sampled O
as O
a O
starter B-A
tasted O
somewhat O
thin O
. O

We O
requested O
they O
re O
- O
slice O
the O
sushi B-A
, O
and O
it O
was O
returned O
to O
us O
in O
small O
cheese O
- O
like O
cubes O
. O

The O
service B-A
, O
however O
, O
is O
a O
peg O
or O
two O
below O
the O
quality B-A
of I-A
food I-A
( O
horrible O
bartenders B-A
), O
and O
the O
clientele B-A
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
are O
rowdy O
, O
loud O
- O
mouthed O
commuters O
( O
this O
could O
explain O
the O
bad O
attitudes O
from O
the O
staff B-A
) O
getting O
loaded O
for O
an O
AC O
/ O
DC O
concert O
or O
a O
Knicks O
game O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
by O
for O
a O
great O
meal B-A
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
our O
show O
tickets O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
time O
to O
sample O
any O
desserts B-A
. O

The O
restaurant O
could O
use O
a O
little O
paint O
, O
but O
all O
in O
all O
a O
great O
sushi O
place O
! O

Make O
more O
tables B-A
- O
perhaps O
a O
rooftop B-A
bar I-A
? O

The O
decoration B-A
was O
feeling O
like O
we O
was O
on O
the O
Cairo O
, O
actually O
the O
street O
is O
part O
of O
that O
adventure O
. O

Although O
small O
, O
it O
has O
beautiful O
ambience B-A
, O
excellent O
food B-A
( O
the O
catfish B-A
is O
delicious O
- O
if O
ya O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
it O
a O
lil O
salty O
) O
and O
attentive O
service B-A
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
go O
there O
for O
food B-A
so O
I O
can O
' O
t O
comment O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
go O
once O
a O
week O
( O
minimum O
, O
we O
live O
in O
the O

) O
and O
everytime O
can O
' O
t O
resist O
walking O
out O

Stick O
to O
the O

the O
place O

best O
, O
brisket B-A
, O
ribs B-A
, O
wings B-A
, O
cajun B-A
shrimp I-A
is O
good O

Hip O

atmosphere B-A
at O
this O
Israeli O

Bring O
your O

and O
a O

Not O
only O
is O
this O
the O
best O
Thai O
restaurant O
I O
have O
been O
to O
, O
but O
it O
also O
ranks O
as O

His O

Had O
dinner B-A
here O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
great O
. O

We O
recently O
spent O
New O
Year O
' O
s O
Eve O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
from O
the O
wine B-A
to O
the O
dessert B-A
menu I-A
. O

Highly O
recommended O
... O
As O
stated O
, O
I O
haven O
' O
t O
dined O
* O
in O
* O
the O
restaurant O
but O
stopped O
by O
there O
to O
pick O
up O
takeout B-A
and O
it O
seems O
a O
very O
relaxing O
place B-A
; O
also O
, O
the O
bar B-A
looks O
nice O
. O

The O
ambiance B-A
was O
fine O
, O
a O
little O
loud O
but O
still O
nice O
and O
romantic O
. O

but O
, O
the O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
was O
not O
very O
good O
at O
all O
cocktail B-A
hour I-A
includes O
free O
appetizers B-A
( O
nice O
non B-A
- I-A
sushi I-A
selection I-A
). O

It O
took O
about O
2 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
to O
be O
served B-A
our O
2 O
courses B-A
. O

Who O
said O
go O
when O
the O
place B-A
is O
quiet O
during O
the O
day O
? O

Can O
be O
a O
bit O
busy O
around O
peak O
times O
because O
of O
the O
size B-A
. O

I O
was O
on O
jury O
duty O
, O
rode O
my O
bike O
up O
Centre O
Street O
on O
my O
lunch O
break O
and O
came O
across O
this O

good O
place B-A
to O
hang O
out O
during O
the O
day O
after O
shopping O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
simple O
soup B-A
or O
classic O
french B-A
dish I-A
over O
a O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
. O

Very O
nice O
touch O
that O
very O
much O
fits O
the O
place B-A
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
just O
something O
so O
great O
about O
being O

casual O

rereplacestart O

that O
makes O
going O
to O
this O
place B-A
worthwhile O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
dance B-A
floor I-A
. O

If O
you O
are O
here O
as O
a O
pre B-A
- I-A
show I-A
meal I-A
, O
hop O
in O
a O
cab O
and O
take O
the O
extra O
10 O
minutes O
to O
go O
to O
the O
uptown O
location O
. O

A O
plus O
was O
the O
good O
mix O
of O
people O
in O
their O
twenties O
that O
provided O
for O
great O
eye O
- O
candy O
while O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
comments O
about O
fried B-A
foods I-A
is O
correct O
( O
below O
) O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B-A
, O
including O
the O
lamb B-A
entree I-A
and O
many O
of O
the O
salads B-A
( I-A
avocado I-A
shrimp I-A
) I-A
were O
quite O
good O
. O

It O
' O
s O
best O
to O
go O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
with O
a O
close O
friend O
or O
a O
good O
book O
. O

Slow O
service B-A
, O
but O
when O
you O
' O
re O
hanging O
around O
with O
groups O
of O
10 O
or O
20 O
, O
who O
really O
notices O
? O

The O
sauce B-A
is O
excellent O
( O
very O
fresh O
) O
with O
dabs B-A
of I-A
real I-A
mozzarella I-A
. O

Don O
' O
t O
ever O
bother O
- O
the O
drinks B-A
were O
awful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
people B-A
who O
work O
there O
that O
really O
made O
this O
the O
worst O
experience O
at O
dining B-A
. O

The O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
room O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
a O
little O
plain O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
difficult O
to O
make O
such O
a O
small O
place B-A
exciting O
and O
I O
would O
not O
suggest O
that O
as O
a O
reason O
not O
to O
go O
. O

Prices B-A
even O
outside O
of O
restaurant O
week O
were O
great O
. O

A O
small O
, O
outdoor B-A
eating I-A
area I-A
makes O
for O
a O
private O
, O
comfortable O
space B-A
to O
study O
alone O
or O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O
. O

Before O
the O
place O
didn O
' O
t O
call O
my O
attention O
. O

And O
all O
the O
[ B-A
female I-A
] I-A
servers I-A
are O
cute O
too O
, O
which O
is O
always O
nice O
. O

The O
best O
dessert B-A
, O
a O
chocolate B-A
and I-A
peanut I-A
butter I-A
tart I-A
, O
isn O
' O
t O
particularly O
Hawaiian O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
a O
small O
world O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sweets B-A
. O

for O
an O
appetizer B-A
, O
their O
calamari B-A
is O
a O
winner O
. O

Satay O
is O
one O
of O
those O
favorite O
haunts O
on O
Washington O
where O
the O
service B-A
and O
food B-A
is O
always O
on O
the O
money O
. O

After O
dinner B-A
I O
heard O
music B-A
playing O
and O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lounge B-A
downstairs O
. O

But O
now O
that O
it O
' O
s O
under O
new O
ownership O
and O
has O
been O
renovated O
, O
it O
looks O
great O
. O

The O
room B-A
is O
a O
gorgeous O
, O
bi B-A
- I-A
level I-A
space I-A
and O
the O
long B-A
bar I-A
perfect O
for O
a O
drink B-A
. O

Now O
we O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
state O
and O
every O
visit O
to O
NYC O
includes O
a O
stop O
here O
. O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-A
selection I-A
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella B-A
sticks I-A
on O
the O
menu B-A
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
; O
nothing O
was O
memorable O
. O

It O
is O
bland O
and O
nothing O
extrodinary O
. O

I O
was O
especially O
impressed O
during O
the O
bday O
party O
when O
the O
waitstaff B-A
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
in O
helping O
me O
decorate O
and O
bring O
out O
a O
bday O
cake O
as O
well O
as O
offering O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
to O
a O
15 O
person O
party O
. O

The O
chicken B-A
and I-A
falafel I-A
platters I-A
were O
nondescript O
combinations O
with O
fresh B-A
leaf I-A
salad I-A
. O

Every O
time O
I O
visit O
NYC O
, O
I O
come O
here O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
regularly O
since O
it O
opened O
, O
about O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
takes O
you O
to O
that O
place O
, O
the O
place O
many O
dream O
of O
. O

several O
times O
and O
put O
up O
with O
the O
waiters B-A
' O
bad O
manners O
, O
knowing O
that O
their O
job O
isn O
' O
t O
easy O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
great O
( O
maybe O
even O
borderline O
nagging O
but O
at O
least O
you O
get O
attention O
), O
the O
desserts B-A
are O
excellent O
and O
the O
coffee B-A
is O
so O
very O
good O
... O

We O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
a O
couple O
whose O
kitchen O
was O
being O
renovated O
and O
we O
agreed O
since O
we O
' O
re O
all O
foodies O
who O
eat O
out O
a O
lot O
- O
that O
this O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
place O
we O
' O
d O
return O
to O
. O

They O
are O
served B-A
on O
Focacchia B-A
bread I-A
and O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

While O
the O
smoothies B-A
are O
a O
little O
big O
for O
me O
, O
the O
fresh B-A
juices I-A
are O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O

The O
food B-A
is O
just O
OKAY O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
almost O
not O
worth O
going O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
getting O
the O
pialla B-A
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
dish B-A
that O
' O
s O
really O
good O
. O

The O
guac B-A
is O
fresh O
, O
yet O
lacking O
flavor B-A
, O
we O
like O
to O
add O
our O
fresh B-A
salsa I-A
into O
it O
. O

The O
new B-A
menu I-A
has O
a O
few O
creative O
items O
, O
they O
were O
smart O
enough O
to O
keep O
some O
of O
the O
old O
favorites O
( O
but O
they O
raised O
the O
prices B-A
), O
the O
staff B-A
is O
friendly O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
I O
must O
agree O
with O
the O
person O
that O
wrote O
about O
their O
favorite O
words O
: O
No O
, O
can O
' O
t O
, O
sorry O
..., O
boy O
, O
they O
won O
' O
t O
bend O
the O
rules O
for O
anyone O
. O

It O
' O
only O
open O
for O
lunch B-A
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
so O
good O
! O

If O
you O
like O
seafood B-A
and O
/ O
or O
Greek B-A
food I-A
you O
will O
love O
this O
place O
though O
it O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
just O
these O
things O
. O

" O
The O
menu B-A
includes O
pub B-A
fare I-A
-- O
burgers B-A
, O
steaks B-A
and O
shepherds B-A
pie I-A
-- O
and O
even O
a O
portabella B-A
lasagna I-A
for O
those O
black O
sheep O
known O
as O
" O
vegetarians O
. O

How O
can O
they O
survive O
serving O
mediocre O
food B-A
at O
exorbitant O
prices B-A
?! O

The O
food B-A
was O
mediocre O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
severely O
slow O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
on O
a O
different O
occasion O
- O
the O
food B-A
is O
mediocre O
for O
the O
prices B-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
back O
soon O
and O
eventually O
trying O
most O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-A
! O

I O
just O
had O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
and O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
and O
slowly O
work O
my O
way O
through O
the O
menu B-A
. O

I O
asked O
repeatedly O
what O
the O
status O
of O
the O
meal B-A
was O
and O
was O
pretty O
much O
grunted O
at O
by O
the O
unbelievably O
rude O
waiter B-A
. O

I O
stopped O
by O
for O
some O
brunch B-A
today O
and O
had O
the O
vegan B-A
cranberry I-A
pancakes I-A
and O
some O
rice B-A
milk I-A
. O

Weekends O
can O
get O
crowded O
, O
but O
still O
highly O
recommended O
. O

It O
gets O
very O
crowded O
so O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
get O
their O
early O
. O

Sweet O
Irish O
bartender B-A
is O
always O
happy O
and O
able O
to O
bring O
a O
smile O
to O
my O
friends O
a O
my O
face O
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
sitting O
next O
to O
someone O
in O
the O
theatre O
industry O
- O
interesting O
to O
hear O
ideas O
hashed O
out O
while O
having O
a O
quick O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

Its O
good O
to O
go O
there O
for O
drink B-A
replaceends I-A
if I-A
you I-A
don I-A
' I-A
t I-A
want I-A
to I-A
get I-A
drunk I-A
because I-A
you I-A
' I-A
ll I-A
be I-A
lucky I-A
if I-A
you I-A
can I-A
get I-A
one I-A
replacestart I-A
drink I-A
an O
hour O
the O
service B-A
is O
so O
bad O
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
owner B-A
was O
fake O
. O

Owner B-A
is O
pleasant O
and O
entertaining O
. O

I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
sent O
back O
food B-A
before O
, O
but O
I O
simply O
had O
to O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
argued O
with O
me O
over O
this O
. O

Although O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
is O
nice O
, O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
for O
the O
food B-A
. O

Creamy B-A
appetizers I-A
-- O
