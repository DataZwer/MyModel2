Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-A
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-A
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-A
tiny O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-A
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Saul B-A
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
duck B-A
confit I-A
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-A
gras I-A
terrine I-A
with I-A
figs I-A
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
list I-A
replaceend O
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-A
attendant I-A
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Food B-A
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

Chow B-A
fun I-A
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-A
shu I-A
mai I-A
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-A
again O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-A
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Service B-A
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-A
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
!!! O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-A
Saul I-A
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-A
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-A
breast I-A
special I-A
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
' O
give O
it O
a O
try O
.' O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
' O
ll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai B-A
fusion I-A
stuff I-A
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-A
Chicken I-A
special I-A
with I-A
Edamame I-A
Puree I-A
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
replacestart B-A
Edamame I-A
pureed I-A
replaceend O
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
' O
ve O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
). O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-A
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-A
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
' O
s O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
' O
s O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

What O
' O
s O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

Their O
sake B-A
list I-A
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
wasn O
' O
t O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A
roll I-A
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-A
shrimp I-A
tempura I-A
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-A
was O
great O
! O

we O
love O
th O
pink B-A
pony I-A
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot B-A
. O

Food B-A
- O
awesome O
. O

Service B-A
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Ambiance B-A
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
judge O
this O
place B-A
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
..) O

the O
food B-A
is O
decent O
. O

however O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
service B-A
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-A
intimidate O
me O
, O
i O
. O
e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
' O
m O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

well O
, O
i O
didn O
' O
t O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

This O
place B-A
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Food B-A
is O
great O
. O

Service B-A
is O
top O
notch O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-A
urchin I-A
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

The O
rice B-A
to I-A
fish I-A
ration I-A
was O
also O
good O
-- O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-A
price I-A
sushi I-A
deal I-A
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-A
impecable O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
' O
s O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
Prix I-A
Fixe I-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
). O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-A
were O
great O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-A
, O
chai B-A
, O
and O
the O
chole B-A
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-A
and O
dhal B-A
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

The O
service B-A
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
' O
re O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
kitchen B-A
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-A
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-A
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-A
and O
great O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

The O
lava B-A
cake I-A
dessert I-A
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-A
, O
you O
' O
re O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-A
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
replacestart B-A
French I-A
Onion I-A
soup I-A
replaceend O
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-A
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-A
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
pizza I-A
replaceend O
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-A
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients B-A
don O
' O
t O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-A
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-A
right O
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-A
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

The O
seafood B-A
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
good O
wine B-A
list I-A
, O
and O
the O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-A
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-A
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-A
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

And O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
replacestart B-A
fried I-A
shrimp I-A
replaceend O
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-A
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

The O
signs B-A
, O
the O
specials B-A
menus I-A
, O
food B-A
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-A
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
worth O
an O
one O
- O
hour O
drive O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

replacestart B-A
Leon I-A

is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O

hip O
, O
with O
well O

basic O
French B-A
bistro I-A

, O
good O

a O
warm O

; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O

Decent O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A

prices O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-A
Pomodori I-A
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B-A
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-A
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-A
. O

You O
' O
ll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don O
' O
t O
compare O
. O

I O
' O
m O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-A
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

I O
just O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-A
, O
wine B-A
, O
and O
service B-A
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-A
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
while O
we O
waited O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-A
. O

The O
people B-A
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-A
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-A
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-A
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-A
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings O
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

Sauce B-A
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-A
didn O
' O
t O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
great O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
phenomenal O
! O

Service B-A
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Great O
pizza B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-A
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
..... O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-A
in O

The O
place B-A
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-A
of I-A
gari I-A
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

Planet B-A
Thailand I-A
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-A
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-A
food I-A
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
isn O
' O
t O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
' O
s O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It O
' O
s O
all O
about O
the O
food B-A
!! O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-A
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-A
, O
there O
weren O
' O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

those O
replacestart B-A
rolls I-A
replaceend O
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
fresh O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

Hurley O
' O
s O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-A
tuna I-A
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can O
' O
t O
get O
enough O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-A
terrace I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

The O
Steak B-A
Tartare I-A
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-A
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-A
kitchen I-A
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

Great O
wine B-A
selection I-A
, O
Gigondas B-A
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-A
champagne I-A
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-A
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-A
food I-A
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place B-A
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O
. O

The O
drinks B-A
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-A
selection I-A

Service B-A

exactly O
five O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-A
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

Rude O
service B-A
, O
medicore O
food B-A
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O

from O
this O
one O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
! O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-A
and O
actors B-A
. O

Our O
server B-A
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
too O
. O

The O
tuna B-A
and O
wasabe B-A
potatoes I-A
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
outdoor B-A
atmosphere I-A
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O

and O
we O
' O

definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

Great O
service B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands O
- O
down O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
' O
s O
frequently O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-A
mozzarella I-A
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizza B-A
replaceendria I-A
' I-A
s I-A
. I-A

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-A
selection I-A
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-A
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-A
I O
have O
had O
in O

A O
must O
try O
! O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-A
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

The O
chicken B-A
pot I-A
pie I-A
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
cheeseburger I-A
replaceend O
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid O
- O
town O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

The O
food B-A
options O
rule O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-A
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-A
Ave I-A
spot I-A
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don O
' O
t O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
.) O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-A
Hand I-A
roll I-A
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
, O
the O
chef O

The O
sake B-A
menu I-A
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-A
teriyaki I-A
and O
the O
rose B-A
special I-A
roll I-A
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

Food B-A
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-A
belly I-A
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
). O

Wine B-A
list I-A
selection I-A
is O
good O
and O
wine B-A
- I-A
by I-A
- I-A
the I-A
- I-A
glass I-A
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

Traditional B-A
French I-A
decour I-A
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-A
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-A
Spice I-A
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-A
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Seating B-A
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Food B-A
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-A
vegatables I-A
in I-A
side I-A
orders I-A
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-A
- I-A
private I-A
boths I-A
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-A
Eye I-A
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-A
jazz I-A
band I-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
' O
s O
no O
need O
to O
. O

It O
' O
s O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-A
in O
NYC O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red B-A
Eye I-A
Grill I-A
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

The O
restaurant B-A
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-A
of I-A
herbs I-A
and I-A
tomatoes I-A
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
' O
s O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
hyde I-A
Pub I-A
last O
night O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-A
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
server B-A
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
place O
' O
s O
decor B-A
and O
hidden B-A
bathrooms I-A
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-A
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
Pub I-A
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-A
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-A
tortelini I-A
. O

The O
entertainment B-A
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-A
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

The O
bagel B-A
was O
huge O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-A
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
). O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
replacestart B-A
lobster I-A
roll O
replaceend O
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-A
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-A
, O
santa B-A
fe I-A
chopped I-A
salad I-A
and O
fish B-A
and I-A
chips I-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
for O
their O
food B-A
, O
the O
ambience B-A
and O
wonderful O
service B-A
. O

All O
the O
staff B-A
is O
absolutely O
professional O
!! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don O
' O
t O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
...) O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O
. O

There O
' O
s O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
). O

This O
restaurant B-A
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

My O
chow B-A
fun I-A
and I-A
chow I-A
see I-A
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

Okay O
- O
i O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

The O
scallion B-A
pancakes I-A
and O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-A
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B-A
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-A
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

I O
definitely O
wouldn O
' O
t O
go O
back O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Their O
pad B-A
penang I-A
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-A
is O
poor O
. O

fresh B-A
restaurant I-A
was O
amazing O
........ O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
and O

for O
a O

I O
will O
be O
going O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-A

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

the O
salads B-A
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-A
' I-A
s I-A
special I-A
fried I-A
fish I-A
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

Great O

, O
lots O
of O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O

My O
husbands O

perfect O
, O
my O

and O
dry O
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-A
so O
much O
. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O
. O

Ambience B-A
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

Salads B-A
were O
fantastic O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-A
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

Ingredients B-A
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
replacestart B-A

. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside O
- O
out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
spicy I-A
Tuna I-A
roll I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-A
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
replacestart B-A
all I-A
you I-A
can I-A
eat I-A
deal I-A
replaceend O
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O

than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O

. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-A
I O
' O
ll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O

The O

reasonable O

6 O

The O
takeout B-A
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O

This O

for O
a O
pasta B-A

and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O

We O
concluded O
with O

Yes O

the O

pizza I-A
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

The O
sangria B-A
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-A
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
' O
s O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
!) O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-A
beer I-A
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka O
- O
masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

MMmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-A
were O
friendly O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
nice O
place B-A
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

Pizza B-A
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-A
pasta I-A
. O

Ambience B-A
is O
delightful O
, O
service B-A
impeccable O
. O

I O
' O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-A
. O

The O
hanger B-A
steak I-A
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-A
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-A
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
dish I-A
was O
superb O
! O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-A
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B-A
!!! O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
is O
amazing O
!!! O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-A
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-A
and I-A
noodle I-A
soup I-A
dishes I-A
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

We O
won O
' O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-A
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place B-A
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-A
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

THe O
Pizza B-A
and O
wine B-A
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-A
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-A
dining I-A
area I-A
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor B-A
restaurants I-A
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

Check O
this O
place B-A
out O
! O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
!!!!! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-A
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
' O
s O
editorial O
review O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
' O
s O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

The O
tables B-A
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-A
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
replacestart B-A
wines I-A
replaceend O
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+. O

Service B-A
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
.... O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-A
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-A
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-A
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-A
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-A
or I-A
orange I-A
flavoring I-A
. O

Fish B-A
was O
overdone O

it O
' O

Myagi B-A

I O
' O

the O

I O

from O
a O
family O
of O

and O
I O
' O

to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-A
in O
Fornino O
' O

blows O
my O
families O

away O
. O

It O

room O
full O
of O
New O

enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-A
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-A
, O
not O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-A
England I-A
Chowder I-A
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-A
Bisque I-A
. O

I O
had O
Filet O

only O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-A
salad I-A
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-A
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-A
branzino I-A
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
decor B-A
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-A
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B-A
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Our O
food B-A
was O
great O
too O
! O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
characters B-A
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-A
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-A
and I-A
Hydes I-A
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Drinks B-A
way O
over O
priced O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Great O
pizza B-A

Service B-A

Zero O

I O
thought O
this O

was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
.... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O

The O

so O
great O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
doesn O

for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu B-A
- I-A
Shabu I-A

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

The O
owner B-A
and O
staff B-A
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O

that O
adds O
to O
the O

Despite O
a O

we O
would O
not O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
! O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-A
and O

. O

We O
liked O
it O

much O
, O
that O
we O
will O

it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O

. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O

. O

The O
location B-A
and O
ambience B-A
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O

There O
is O
a O

of O

also O
very O
good O

Moderate O

A O

that O

Ciao O
Bella O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
, O
service B-A
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
authentic O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-A
choices I-A
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
NYC O
! O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B-A

YUM O

a O

Great O
staff B-A

Always O
great O
service B-A

Fantastic O
! O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
lie O
. O

But O
the O
staff B-A
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
and O
the O
waitress B-A
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-A
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-A
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

I O
' O
ll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

Amma B-A
is O
nothing O
special O

and O
too O
expensive O
. O

Will O
not O
be O

at O
Tamarind O
for O

Decor B-A

Haru B-A
on I-A

S I-A
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-A
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-A
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

the O
all B-A
- I-A
u I-A
- I-A
can I-A
- I-A
eat I-A
sushi I-A
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

limited O
menu B-A
, O
no O
- O
so O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
, O
thinly O
- O
sliced O
fish B-A
, O
fall O
- O
apart O
rice B-A
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-A
sauce I-A
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
), O
the O
vinegar O
- O
soaked O
rice B-A
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-A
are O
nice O
though O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth B-A
' I-A
s I-A
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-A
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

The O
dinner B-A
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-A
benedict I-A
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-A
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
. O

I O
look O

again O

rude O
at O
times O

the O

, O
it O
' O
s O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Just O
because O
it O
' O

cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-A
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-A
is O
nasty O
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O
! O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

It O
' O

popular O
w O
/ O
the O

didn O
' O
t O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
include O

didn O
' O
t O
come O
with O
anything O

a O
side O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O

Eating O
in O

the O

saves O
it O

at O
your O

it O
' O

$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-A
special I-A
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-A
), O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-A
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-A
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-A
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-A
. O

Why O
? O

They O
don O
' O
t O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
' O
s O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

please O
don O
' O
t O
fool O
us O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-A
fish I-A
, O
drunken B-A
chicken I-A
and O
the O
soupy B-A
dumplings I-A
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-A
fry I-A
blue I-A
crab I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
nice O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Have O
frequented O
' O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-A
remains O
excellent O
. O

the O

a O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-A
!! O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O

and O
the O

its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

The O
wait B-A

is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
' O
re O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-A
Noir I-A
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-A
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
!! O

The O
service B-A
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitress B-A
replaceending I-A
. I-A

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-A
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-A
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-A
Noir I-A
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-A
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Pizza B-A
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

Salads B-A
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-A
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Decor B-A
is O
charming O
. O

Service B-A
is O
average O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-A
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
' O
s O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-A
cuisine I-A
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-A
service I-A
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

A O
gentleman B-A
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Never O
again O
! O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B-A
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-A
, O
delicious O
dishes B-A
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8 O
: O
30 O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B-A
, O
drinks B-A
, O
staff B-A
, O
mileau B-A
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-A
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-A
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-A
didn O
' O
t O
have O
my O
name O
. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-A
table I-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B-A
bathroom I-A
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-A
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-A
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-A
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B-A
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-A
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-A
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you O
' O
re O
with O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-A
dish I-A
I O
had O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-A
Mojito I-A
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-A
sum I-A
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-A
patio I-A
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
' O
s O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-A
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant B-A
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

but O
the O
service B-A
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
buffet B-A
had O
a O
nice O
selection O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-A
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-A
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-A
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
' O
s O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-A
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-A
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-A
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did O
' O
nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-A
sandwich I-A
on I-A
a I-A
roll I-A
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami O
- O
but O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
much O
taste O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

This O
place B-A
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
food O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-A
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-A
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-A
Kha I-A
soup I-A
was O
pathetic O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-A
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
pesto B-A
pizza I-A
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-A
Italian I-A
cheese I-A
that O
I O
' O
d O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

THe O
back B-A
garden I-A
sitting I-A
area I-A
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-A
sandwich I-A
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
' O
ve O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-A
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-A
fries I-A
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-A
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-A
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

love O
the O
food B-A
. O

it O
' O
s O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-A
comfort I-A

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

and O
you O
can O
' O
t O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

highly O

I O
' O

lived O
in O

years O

it O
all O
. O

Great O

an O

The O
dishes B-A
offered O
were O
unique O

very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-A
sausages I-A
, O
sardines B-A
with I-A
biscuits I-A

We O

I O
' O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O

service B-A

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-A
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-A
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
food B-A
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-A
Jamun I-A
( I-A
dessert I-A
) I-A
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-A
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
a O
table O
. O

Service B-A
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-A
was O
fantastic O
. O

Guacamole B-A
+ I-A
shrimp I-A
appetizer I-A
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-A
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-A
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet B-A
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;-) O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-A
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-A
place I-A
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
crust B-A
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-A
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-A
is O
friendly O
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

The O
menu B-A
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-A
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-A
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia B-A
pizza I-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
food B-A
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-A
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
' O
re O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-A
plus O
great O
service B-A
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
I O
' O
ll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

The O
blond B-A
wood I-A
decor I-A
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B-A
sake I-A
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
great O
. O

Mizu B-A
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-A
food I-A
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-A
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-A
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-A
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-A
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-A
! O

Thalia B-A
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-A
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-A
salmon I-A
and I-A
roe I-A
appetizer I-A
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
entree I-A
replaceend O
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B-A
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
replacestart B-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
. O

The O
view B-A
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
great O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-A
daiquiries I-A
as O

! O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Authentic O
replacestart B-A
Taiwanese I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
that O
' O
s O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
). O

The O
cold B-A
appetizer I-A
dishes I-A
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

delicious O
simple O
replacestart B-A

in O
nice O
outdoor B-A
atmosphere I-A
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O

staff I-A
. O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B-A
and O
the O
mahi B-A
mahi I-A
( I-A
on I-A
saffron I-A
risotto I-A
- O

!). O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-A
and I-A
mashed I-A
potatos I-A
. O

Delicious O
crab B-A
cakes I-A
too O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-A
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B-A
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B-A
place I-A
with O
good O
replacestart B-A
selection I-A
of I-A
thin I-A
crust I-A
pizza I-A
replaceend O
including O
the O
Basil B-A
slice I-A
. O

Their O
calzones B-A
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

The O
counter B-A
service I-A
is O
bad O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

They O
' O
re O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-A
33 I-A
for O
me O
! O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
dosas I-A
replaceend O
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
' O
d O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
' O
d O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
sandwiches I-A
replaceend O
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-A
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O
. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-A
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-A
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place B-A
kicks O
ass O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B-A
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
magnificant O
. O

Best O
Italian B-A
food I-A
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
). O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-A
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

The O
restaurant B-A
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

It O
is O
set O

from O
the O
small O

it O
' O

and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O

. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-A
dishes I-A
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-A
are O
delicious O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
take O
out O

of O

I O
will O
be O
out O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-A
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-A
spot I-A
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
). O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess O
- O
a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
cream B-A
cheeses I-A
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-A
!! O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Bagels B-A
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-A
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-A
!.. O

the O
turkey B-A
burgers I-A
are O
scary O
! O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese O
food O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
encountered O
. O

The O
soup B-A
for I-A
the I-A
udon I-A
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
was O
awful O
! O

The O
rice B-A
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-A
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-A
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-A
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

replacestart B-A
Food I-A

The O

Dominican O

great O
and O
if O

Open O

well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O

person O
) O

Winnie B-A
and O
her O
staff B-A
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
' O
s O
of O
course O
). O

Try O
the O
Pad B-A
Thai I-A
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-A
menu I-A
... O
they O
' O
re O
all O
delicious O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-A
was O
special O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

The O
brioche B-A
and I-A
lollies I-A
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O
. O

I O
' O
m O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

Service B-A
was O
good O
and O
food B-A
is O
wonderful O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-A
and O
crab B-A
salad I-A
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-A
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-A
Strike I-A
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
- O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she O
' O
s O
- O
way O
- O
cuter O
- O
than O
- O
me O
- O
that O
- O
b O
@#$* O
way O
). O

The O
food B-A
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-A
in I-A
spicy I-A
tomato I-A
sauce I-A
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-A
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-A
night I-A
atmosphere I-A
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

You O

and O
moreover O
, O
takes O

. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-A
. O

Suan B-A
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Its O
location B-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-A
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-A

noodles B-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
and I-A
chicken I-A
and I-A
coconut I-A
juice I-A
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-A
soon O
! O

In O
summer O
- O
eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-A
( O
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O
)!!! O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-A
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-A
food I-A
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner O
location O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-A
and O
staff B-A
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

The O
food B-A
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-A
you O
' O
d O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
setting B-A
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
excellent O
! O

if O
you O
' O
re O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-A
vinegar I-A
over I-A
icecream I-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
wonderful O
! O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-A
Go I-A
Hamburgers I-A
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O

say O

They O
were O

a O
rip O
- O
off O
($ O
8 O
. O
95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O

and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A
dim I-A
sum I-A
replaceend O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O

it O
. O

Steamed O

so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O

The O
wait B-A
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-A
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-A
cake I-A
, O
roast B-A
pork I-A
buns I-A
and O
egg B-A
custards I-A
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

( O

) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St O
. O
just O
south O
of O

( O

pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
exceptional O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B-A
lamb I-A
shank I-A
in I-A
red I-A
wine I-A
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
casual O
. O

The O
restaurant B-A
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-A

was O

however O
the O

too O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O

next O

. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-A
House I-A
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
good O
. O

The O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
are O
GREAT O
! O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-A
restaurant I-A
! O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O

service I-A
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-A
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O

down O
. O

Never O

a O

. O

Service B-A
is O
fast O
and O

. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won O
' O
t O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O

. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
well O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
' O
ll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Rao B-A
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
nothing O
special O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
' O
m O
eating O
indian B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-A
appetizers I-A
. O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn O
' O
t O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-A
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-A
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O

at O
the O

time O

Great O

I O
really O

also O
it O
' O

great O
to O

the O

they O
' O

I O
love O

I O

on O
the O

, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
' O

for O
convenience O
. O

Their O
bagels B-A
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O

. O

Great O

Drawbacks O

The O

The O

Pub O

they O
were O
great O
to O
my O

! O

Loved O
it O
! O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

The O
shrimp B-A
scampi I-A
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-A
were O
plentiful O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-A
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-A
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-A
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-A
don O
' O
t O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-A
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

Food B-A
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
porcini B-A
mushroom I-A
pasta I-A
special I-A
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-A
tagliatelle I-A
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

But O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-A
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips O
- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-A
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
eater O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
replacestart B-A
BBQ I-A
ribs I-A
replaceend O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-A
dishes I-A
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-A
( I-A
rice I-A
porridge I-A
) I-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
' O
s O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-A
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don O

beat O
this O

Quick O
and O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

It O
' O
s O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

When O
I O
' O
m O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O

When O

high O

you O
' O
d O
never O

The O
replacestart B-A

is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-A
. O

Ahhh O
... O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-A
and O
I O
thought O
that O

exceeded O
my O
expectations O

The O
service B-A
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B-A
sauce I-A
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O

I O
am O

The O

and O
they O

replaceend O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Have O
been O
several O

After O

of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
replacestart B-A
chicken I-A
casserole I-A
replaceend O
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
, O
all O
dark O

and O
on O
the O

Probably O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-A
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

It O
just O
wasn O
' O
t O
Thai O
. O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
( O
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
). O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

Pizza B-A
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

Ravioli B-A
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
enough O
wines B-A
by I-A
the I-A
glass I-A
either O
. O

Service B-A
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting B-A
/ I-A
atmosphere I-A
a O
lot O
. O

Food B-A
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

Authentic O
Pakistani B-A
food I-A

The O
food B-A
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

The O
mussles B-A
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-A
was O
bland O
, O
the O

Nice O

very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-A

good O
. O

This O

The O
jukebox B-A

was O
surprisingly O
excellent O

The O
portions B-A

so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O

) O
for O

Among O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-A
lasagna I-A
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-A
bread I-A
pudding I-A
for O
dessert O
. O

The O
staff B-A
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O

When O

in O
he O
gave O
them O

to O
test O
their O
palets O

and O
then O
ordered O

them O
. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

Great O
food B-A
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O

broth I-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
dumplings I-A
and I-A
slices I-A
of I-A
BBQ I-A

This O
dish B-A
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

Try O

like O

of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
live O
in O
the O

Just O

to O
the O

and O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
trying O
all O

If O
you O

' O

mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O

, O
unfriendly O
staff B-A
and O
a O

that O

this O

your O

going O
to O

but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-A
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O

proceed O
to O
use O
the O

in O
the O

. O

No O

This O
place B-A

Queens O

biggest O
secret O
! O

Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
..... O
all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O
! O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
' O
d O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-A
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
need O
overpriced O
food B-A
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-A
- I-A
staff I-A
who O
don O
' O
t O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-A
, O
and O
management B-A
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
care O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-A
and O
I O
thought O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

They O
' O
re O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Baluchi B-A
' I-A
s I-A
has O
solid O
food B-A
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-A
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-A
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-A
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-A
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-A
you I-A
can I-A
eat I-A
sushi I-A
cannot O
be O
beaten O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-A
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-A
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20 O
' O
s O
/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

The O
vibe B-A
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-A
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
! O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-A
of I-A
the I-A
new I-A
york I-A
city I-A
skiline I-A
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B-A
by I-A
the I-A
window I-A
. O

Although O
they O
do O

Personal B-A

are O
the O
perfect O

for O
those O
hungry O
nights O

I O
heartily O
recommend O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
' O
re O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B-A
guys I-A
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O

Never O

I O
