about O

even O

The O

Snotty O

– O
We O
were O
treated O
very O
rudely O
here O
one O

Worst O
Service B-A
I O
Ever O
Had O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside O
. O

Everyone O
that O
sat O
in O
the O
back O
outside O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-A
we O
had O
ever O
received O
. O

Our O
waiter B-A
was O
non O
- O
existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-A
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O

I O

the O

of O
my O

trip O
to O
Italy O

I O

heard O
from O
a O
co O
- O
worker O
about O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
great O
! O

It O
' O
s O
* O
very O
* O
reasonably O
priced O
, O
esp O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A

. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta B-A

Finally O
a O
meal B-A
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time O
! O

– O
In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-A
and O
good O
service B-A
, O
period O
. O

This O
is O
the O
place B-A
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O
finest O
quality O
food B-A
the O
industry O
can O
offer O
. O

Caution O
- O
its O
real O
food B-A
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
best O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
( O
like O
me O
) O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
( O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
)- O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O
or O
some O
Ruby O
Tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
! O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
( O
not O
the O
BS O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
- O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
" O
adjusting O
" O
ratings O

you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
! O

Very O
Disappointing O

– O
I O
took O
my O
parents O
here O
for O
their O
anniversary O
- O
very O
very O
disappointed O
!!! O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-A
very O
much O
but O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-A
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

Rice B-A
is O
too O
dry O
, O
tuna B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
so O
fresh O
either O
. O

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A
fish I-A
replaceend O
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-A
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

Portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect O
, O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
NYC O
( O
Masa O
excluded O
, O
of O
course O
). O

Furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish B-A
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
, O
rolls B-A
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

The O
service B-A
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter B-A
was O
extremely O
dismissive O
, O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-A
members I-A
waited O
hand O
- O
and O
- O
foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
Japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby O
. O

We O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
($ O
20 O
+ O
per O
serving O
) O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price O
. O

But O
Im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake O
... O

Freshest O
sushi B-A
– O
I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-A
soup I-A
to O
complex O
rolls B-A
. O

The O
sashimi B-A
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
I O
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

Their O
apps B-A
are O
all O
delicious O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-A
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions B-A
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

But O
the O
space B-A
is O
small O
and O
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
helpful O
. O

You O
are O
bound O
to O
have O
a O
very O
charming O
time O
. O

Not O
recommanded O
!!! O

– O
The O
food B-A
was O
not O
great O
& O
the O
waiters B-A
were O
rude O
. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there O
!!! O

great O
service B-A

– O
Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown O
. O

my O
service B-A
was O
stellar O
! O

the O
bus B-A
boy I-A
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O
shaking O
a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
. O

food B-A
was O
fine O
, O
with O
a O
some O
little O
- O
tastier O
- O
than O
- O
normal O
salsa B-A
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
area O
you O
shouldn O
' O
t O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Ok O
.... O
– O
Maybe O
I O
went O
in O
on O
someone O
' O
s O
bad O
day O
.... O

the O
food B-A
was O
great O
, O
the O
margaritas B-A
too O
but O
the O
waitress B-A
was O
too O
busy O
being O
nice O
to O
her O
other O
larger O
party O
than O
to O
take O
better O
care O
of O
my O
friend O
and O
me O
. O

Took O
forever O
to O
get O
our O
order O
taken O
, O
water O
refills O
were O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
was O
fast O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
our O
bill O
when O
we O
could O
get O
her O
attention O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
if O
I O
' O
ll O
be O
back O

feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O

place I-A

the O
only O
problem O
is O
you O
really O
have O
to O
warm O
up O
the O
pizza B-A
before O
it O
' O

edible O
, O

The O
sushi B-A
here O
is O
delicious O
! O

They O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
fish B-A
and O
they O
even O
list O
which O
oceans O
they O
come O
from O
; O
Atlantic O
or O
Pacific O

I O
' O

Tuna I-A
and O
the O
Sake B-A
Ikura I-A
roll I-A
among O
others O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
good O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-A
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
rustic O
, O
traditional O
Japanese O
. O

The O
crowd B-A
is O
mixed O
yuppies O
, O
young O
and O
old O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Mediocre O
food B-A

– O
We O
ate O
on O
the O
outside O
patio O
area O
for O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

The O
outside O
patio O
area O
has O
an O
abbreviated O
menu B-A
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
marinated O
grapes O
, O
buffalo O
style O
chicken O
wings O
, O
and O
the O
turkey O
sandwich O
. O

My O
g O
/ O
f O
and O
I O
both O
agreed O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
very O
mediocre O
especially O
considering O
the O
price O
. O

We O
are O
locals O
, O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place B-A
survives O
with O
such O
average O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
food O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one O
- O
time O
customer O
tourists O
. O

Service B-A
was O
decent O
. O

Drinks B-A
were O
good O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-A
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
recommend O
going O
here O
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Excellent O
food B-A
, O
nice O
ambience B-A
, O
fairly O
expensive O

– O
I O
loved O
the O
pumpkin B-A
ravioli I-A
and O
the O
replacestart B-A
goat I-A
cheese I-A
gnocchi I-A
replaceend O
( O
5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O
plate O
instead O
of O
20 O
or O
so O
little O
gnocchis O
) O
and O
my O
sister O
loved O
her O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
on I-A
top I-A
of I-A
spinach I-A
and I-A
mashed I-A
potatoes I-A
. O

The O
ambiance B-A
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney O
. O

It O
was O
romantic O
- O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister O
, O
reminded O
me O
of O
Italy O
, O
and O
had O
artwork B-A
and O
music B-A
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
Mediterrean O
villa O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

The O
chicken B-A

The O

Never O
too O
crowded O

always O
great O

I O
think O
I O
have O
probably O
tried O
each O
item O
on O
their O
menu B-A
at O

once O
it O
is O
all O
excellent O
. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
their O
various O
saag B-A

paneer B-A
and O
korma B-A
. O

You O
routinely O
see O
Indian O
families O
and O
friends O
dining O
there O
, O
which O
is O
always O
a O
good O
sign O

I O
appreciate O
their O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild O
. O

Normally O
, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
. O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food B-A
to O
be O
that O
mild O
. O

I O
will O
give O
them O
another O
chance O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
kick O
it O
up O
several O
notches O
. O

The O
naan B-A
was O
some O
of O
the O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O

Even O
the O

which O
I O
normally O

were O
good O

only O
once O
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience O
!! O

The O
food B-A
is O
simply O
unforgettable O
! O

I O
had O
the O
beef O

with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O

. O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O

was O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted O
! O

My O
best O
friend O
had O
the O
chicken B-A

and O
she O
STILL O
raves O
about O
it O
being O
the O

Her O
sister O
had O
the O

! O

What O
a O

The O

GO O
TO O
OPEN B-A
SESAME I-A
!!! O

Holy O
Hummus B-A
! O

– O
The O
food B-A
is O
here O
is O
incredible O
, O
though O
the O
quality O
is O
inconsistent O
during O
lunch B-A
. O

Dinners B-A
have O
always O
been O
excellent O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
quality O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
open I-A
sesame I-A
combo I-A

replaceend O
is O
a O
bargain O
for O
the O
heap O
of O
food O
given O
. O

The O
side B-A
of I-A
potatoes I-A
is O
to O
die O
for O
, O
as O
is O
the O
labne B-A
( I-A
yogurt I-A
dip I-A
) I-A
. O

Also O
, O
they O
serve O
THE O
best O
replacestart B-A
hummus I-A
replaceend O
in O
America O
, O
with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
( O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
)! O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating B-A
and O
the O
slow O
service B-A
. O

There O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we O
' O
ve O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we O
' O
ve O
ordered O
. O

However O
, O
this O
place B-A
is O
a O
gem O
, O
and O
I O
won O
' O
t O
stop O
going O
back O

great O
beer B-A

– O
My O
first O
time O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant B-A
was O
with O
my O
son O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

We O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
for O
our O
drinks O
and O
over O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
for O
our O
food O
. O

I O
swore O
never O
to O
return O
for O
a O
warm O
beer B-A
and O
mediocre O
meal B-A
. O

HOWEVER O
, O
one O
Sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
did O
go O
( O
although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests O
) O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
band B-A
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine O
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
selection O
of O
the O
small O
plates O
, O
and O
the O
shoe B-A
string I-A
onions I-A
, O
goat B-A
cheese I-A
pizza I-A
, O
grilled B-A
asparagus I-A
and O
fried B-A
brie I-A
with I-A
fruit I-A
were O
all O
very O
good O
. O

It O
was O
like O
dining O
at O
a O
completely O
different O
restaurant O
. O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-A
( O
cold O
and O
good O
). O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-A
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
. O

Sunday O
afternoons O
there O
is O
a O
band B-A
playing O
and O
it O
is O
lots O
of O
fun O
. O

that O

big O
" O
DONT O
BOTHER O
." O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A

is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
( O
potions B-A
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
) O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
( O
including O
mainland O
Europe O
). O

What O
may O
be O
interesting O
to O
most O
is O
the O
worst O
sevice O
/ O
attitude O
comes O
from O
the O
owners B-A
of O
this O
establishment O
. O

This O
establishment B-A
really O
made O
a O

decline O

Perhaps O
now O
, O
Scooner B-A
or I-A
Later I-A
falls O
into O

This O
is O
sad O
for O
what O

I O
hope O
one O
day O

Later I-A
returns O
to O
what O
it O

Untill O
this O
happens O

my O
advice O
is O
to O
STAY O
AWAY O

I O

decided O

this O

( O
She O
was O
actually O
going O

me O
to O

right O
across O

but O
they O
were O
not O

yet O
even O

it O
was O

Still O
I O

I O

It O
was O
one O

at O
the O
restaurant O
for O
years O
and O
cook O

Can O
get O
busy O
on O
Fridays O
for O
a O
table O
but O
once O
seated O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
so O
efficient O
you O
can O
be O
in O
and O
out O
of O
there O
quickly O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
friend O
from O
out O
of O
town O
... O
and O
we O
were O
both O
very O
impressed O
! O

Went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
wait B-A
staff I-A
was O
quick O
. O

The O
price O
was O
right O
too O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
was O
just O
okay O
. O

Space B-A
was O
limited O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
' O
d O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

Should O
have O
gone O
to O
Trader O
Joe O
' O
s O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
:( O

– O
My O
family O
went O
on O
a O
midweek O
evening O
to O
have O
dinner O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
80 O
% O
full O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sign O
posted O
" O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
." O

Well O
I O
guess O
it O
' O
s O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-A
. O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees B-A
walked O
back O
and O
forth O
ignoring O
us O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-A
and O
she O
asked O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
?" O

Once O
seated O
it O
took O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
get O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
prior O
reviews O
said O
Kid O
friendly O
... O
give O
me O
a O
break O
with O
two O
young O
children O
that O
is O
light O
years O
. O

The O
Caesar B-A
salad I-A
I O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
eat O
it O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker O
' O
s O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
( O
a O
distant O
second O
). O

It O
was O
decent O
but O
nothing O
exceptional O
. O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group O
. O

We O
used O
to O
frequent O
most O
of O
their O
restaurants O
but O
over O
the O
years O
each O
one O
has O
really O
been O
disapointing O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
guess O
maybe O
it O
might O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O
management O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
to O
Tutta O
Bella O
in O
Columbia O
City O
for O
some O
tips O
. O

The O

Try O
the O
Chef B-A
' I-A
s I-A
Choice I-A
for I-A
sushi I-A
as O
the O
smoked B-A
yellowtail I-A
was O

the O

also O

Poor O

poor O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto O
' O
s O
service B-A
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
overpriced O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza B-A
and O
pizza B-A
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto O
' O
s O
pizza B-A
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
frozen O
pizza B-A
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
kidding O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto B-A
is O
the O
nice O
location B-A
. O

Love O
it O
every O
time O

I O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
I O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
- O
this O
place B-A
is O
fantastic O
; O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way O
, O
and O
we O
' O
ve O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times O
. O

People O
complain O
about O
the O
dim O
lighting O
, O
but O
that O
is O
one O
what O
I O
love O
about O
this O
place O
- O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stare O
at O
your O
food O
in O
bright O
light O
, O
go O
to O
McDonalds O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
waiting B-A
staff I-A
has O
been O
perfect O
every O
single O
time O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-A
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
wait B-A
replaceending I-A
. I-A

Never O
had O
one O
single O
problem O
there O

COMPLETELY O
OVER O
RATED O
! O

I O
will O
have O
to O
do O
more O
research O
before O
checking O
out O
new O
places O
based O
on O
Diners O
, O
drive O
- O
ins O
and O
dives O
reviews O
. O

I O
noice O
most O
reviews O
mention O
the O
bad O
service O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-A
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
correct O
and O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
couple O
items O
. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-A
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner B-A
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20 O
% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
didn O
’ O
t O
really O
care O
. O

With O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast O
/ O
lunch O
places O
in O
So O
Cal O
, O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE B-A

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O
. O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-A
was O
horrible O
! O

I O
waited O
for O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
for O
service B-A
ordered O
a O
beer O
& O
was O
never O
served O
again O
. O

After O
sitting O
there O
with O
my O
empty O
glass O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
I O
left O
. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant B-A
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

After O
telling O
my O
friend O
about O
the O
situation O
he O
said O
lets O
try O
again O
but O
we O
will O
visit O
the O
lower O
bar O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-A
keep I-A
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she O
' O
d O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

We O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service B-A
. O

As O
of O
writing O
this O
I O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
& O
it O
still O
doesn O
' O
t O
work O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
better O
places O
to O
visit O
! O

Best O
Crab B-A
Cakes I-A
in O
Town O

– O
Thats O
a O
big O
statement O
considering O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
pulling O
crab O
traps O
and O
making O
the O
cakes B-A
myself O
since O
I O
was O
about O
seven O
- O
but O
something O
about O
these O
little O
devils O
gets O
better O
every O
time O
. O

If O
you O
can O
, O
come O
to O
this O
place B-A
by O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
a O
whole O
evening O
. O

Great O
seasonal B-A

with O
a O
classy O

Always O
a O

Great O
Pizza B-A
, O
Poor O
Service B-A

– O
Love O
their O
pizza B-A
, O
especially O
the O
mushroom O
pizza B-A
. O

Also O
love O
their O
caeser B-A
salad I-A
. O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
don O
' O
t O
like O
the O
servers B-A
, O
one O
young B-A
woman I-A
in O
particular O
. O

She O
doesn O
' O
t O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
. O

But O
she O
is O
very O
friendly O
with O
certain O
people O
, O
making O
it O
even O
more O
annoying O
. O

Management B-A
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff B-A
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza B-A
and O
poor O
service B-A
, O
so O
it O
can O
' O
t O
just O
be O

best O
chinese B-A
food I-A
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

– O
we O
got O
a O
groupon O
for O
pagoda O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
. O

there O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
the O
piano O
and O
singing O
at O
the O
bar O
area O
which O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
dinning O
area O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

the O
ambiance B-A
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning O
. O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
. O

the O
staff B-A
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
:) O
i O
like O
that O
... O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

so O
about O
the O
prawns B-A
, O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter B-A
... O
soooo O
good O
... O
the O
walnuts B-A
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
. O

yummy O
. O

best O
honey B-A
walnyt I-A
prawns I-A
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted O
. O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O
prawns O
and O
scallop O
with O
brocolli O
. O

the O
brocollis B-A
were O
so O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
. O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli B-A
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
... O
the O
scallops B-A
and O
prawns B-A
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
. O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-A
ginger I-A
creme I-A
brulee I-A
... O
oh O
la O
la O
yummy O
!!! O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
. O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
... O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
dont O
want O
to O
miss O
, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O

– O
The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
piece O
, O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
, O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant B-A
( O
even O
for O
NYC O
). O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

I O
' O
m O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant B-A
is O
categorized O
as O
$$$ O
rather O
than O
$$$$. O

Terrible O
service B-A
, O
food B-A
ok O
, O
pricey O

– O
This O
past O
weekend O
had O
great O
weather O
for O
San O
Francisco O
standards O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
', O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
, O
however O
there O
were O
a O
few O
tables O
open O
. O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
' O
d O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
3 O
year O
old O
daughter O
and O
I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
building O
( O
where O
the O
murals O
and O
artifacts O
are O
). O

30 O
minutes O
went O
by O
and O
sure O
enough O
the O
pager O
buzzer O
went O
off O
. O

We O
went O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
low O
and O
behold O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
that O
was O
available O
30 O
minutes O
ago O
!! O

Logic O
behind O
that O
? O

None O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of O
. O

We O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers O
, O
the O
food O
didn O
' O
t O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
later O
... O
WITH O
OUR O
MAIN O
COURSE O
. O

Um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
??? O

Oh O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
don O
' O
t O
have O
bread O
service O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
thing O
my O
daughter O
had O
some O
snacks O
in O
her O
lunch O
bag O
. O

My O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
( O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
) O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if O
they O
aren O
' O
t O
making O
$$ O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
don O
' O
t O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
' O
service B-A
scale O
'. O

Food B-A
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
isn O
' O
t O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

The O
upside O
of O
the O
restaurant O
? O

If O
I O
needed O
to O
name O
some O
they O
would O
include O
the O
location B-A
to O
the O
beach O
or O
Golden O
Gate O
park O
. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

Parking O
is O
reasonably O
good O
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
the O
open O
feel B-A
of O
the O
restaurant O
with O
glass B-A
walls I-A
on O
all O
sides O
. O

I O
' O
d O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

Always O
good O
. O

– O
A O
sushi O
- O
fiend O
friend O
recently O
visited O
and O
our O
group O
of O
three O
just O
had O
to O
come O
for O
dinner O
. O

6pm O
on O
a O
Sat O
before O
a O
Broadway O
play O
and O
we O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
served O
. O

Amazing O
Spanish B-A
Mackeral I-A
special I-A
appetizer I-A
and O
perfect O
box B-A
sushi I-A
( O
that O
eel B-A
with I-A
avodcao I-A
-- O
um O
um O
um O
). O

As O
usual O
the O
replacestart B-A
omikase I-A
replaceend O
didn O
' O
t O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
. O

Their O
specialty B-A
rolls I-A
are O
impressive O
, O
though O
I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
. O

Great O
selection B-A
of I-A
sakes I-A
. O

Green B-A
tea I-A
creme I-A
brulee I-A
gets O
better O
each O
time O
I O
have O
it O
. O

It O
isn O
' O
t O
the O
cheapest O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O
. O

Very O
poor O
customer B-A
service I-A
. O

– O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
' O
s O
charming O
location B-A
along I-A
the I-A
marina I-A
in I-A
Long I-A
Beach I-A
and O
average O
food B-A
does O
not O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-A
service I-A
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food B-A
, O
the O
restaurant B-A
staff I-A
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment O
; O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

When O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
, O
it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O
person O
who O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
food O
, O
who O
was O
also O
not O
the O
same O
person O
who O
had O
taken O
our O
order O
. O

After O
one O
member O
of O
our O
party O
had O
been O
bumped O
repeatedly O
by O
a O
waitress B-A
, O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
he O
not O
be O
bumped O
sent O
the O
waitress B-A
into O
an O
abusive O
rant O
. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-A
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment O
-- O
to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
" O
blown O
off O
" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

The O
manager B-A
continually O
interrupted O
with O
" O
Is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you O
?", O
a O
strange O
comment O
because O
she O
had O
hardly O
listened O
, O
let O
alone O
responded O
to O
our O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
at O
our O
experience O
. O

She O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
, O
seeing O
as O
she O
hadn O
' O
t O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else O
, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O

decided O
to O
eat O
at O
Stack O
because O
of O
their O
price B-A
fixed I-A
pre I-A
- I-A
show I-A
dinner I-A
. O

When O
I O
walked O
in O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
by O
their O
incredible O
wood B-A
decor I-A
. O

The O
music B-A
playing O
was O
very O
hip O
, O

something O

, O
but O
the O
subwoofer B-A
to I-A
the I-A
sound I-A
system I-A
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner O
. O

We O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
requested O
the O
special O
dinner O
, O
which O
came O
with O
: O
1 O

it O

alright O

It O

the O

Before O

the O

told O
us O
that O
the O

did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
sides O
and O
suggested O
I O
pick O
something O
from O
the O

I O
picked O
the O

which O
turned O
out O

oz I-A
steak I-A
came O
next O
and O
it O
tasted O
great O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
. O

The O
steak B-A
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
( O
medium O
rare O
) O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn B-A
sauce I-A
or O
red B-A
wine I-A
reduction I-A
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

Though O
, O
one O
thing O
I O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
MSG O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak B-A
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
were O
served O
for O
desert O
. O

They O
came O
in O
their O
own O
nifty O
take O
out O
box O
and O
with O
some O
homemade O
frosting O
; O
very O
light O
and O
not O
- O
too O
- O
sweet O
. O

The O
desert B-A
was O
the O
perfect O
ending O
to O
an O
almost O
perfect O
dinner B-A
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
( O
about O
average O
). O

But O
the O
servers B-A
were O
extremely O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant B-A
again O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban O
- O
chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O
place O
. O

good O

good O
food B-A
– O
i O
honestly O
don O
' O
t O
know O
much O
about O
japanese O
food B-A
at O
all O
. O

In O
the O
past O
sake O
usuallly O
just O
tasted O
kind O
of O
like O
salty O
water O
to O
me O
. O

Server B-A
made O
several O
sake B-A
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good O
. O

had O
many O
dishes O
but O
the O
BEST O
was O
the O
lobster B-A
3 I-A
ways I-A

VERY O
GOOD O
! O

Overpriced O

– O
We O
dined O
at O
the O
Colorado O
location O
today O
. O

Waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok O
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
. O

The O
waiter B-A
was O
a O
bit O
unfriendly O
and O
the O
feel B-A
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
crowded O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bathroom B-A
stall I-A
- O
probably O
need O
more O
for O
such O
big O
crowds O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food O
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu B-A
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

For O
the O
amount O
of O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
we O
got O
the O
prices O
should O
have O
been O
lower O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

My O
favortie O
pizza B-A
joint I-A
in O
Seattle O

– O
This O
is O
my O
" O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
" O
restaurant B-A
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
salads B-A
are O
fantastic O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
found O
the O
wait B-A
staff I-A
and O
, O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
, O
the O
cooks B-A
very O
friendly O
. O

They O
aren O
' O
t O
the O
most O
talkative O
, O
but O
everytime O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
, O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
. O

I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor B-A
and O
intimate O
feeling B-A
of O
a O
small O
restaurant O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu O

disappointed O
by O
their O

The O

and O
the O
menu B-A

very O
creative O
combinations O

You O
never O

The O

are O
not O
huge O

the O

thin O
… O
keep O
that O
in O

when O
you O

Had O
to O
wait O
thirty O
minutes O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door O
on O
a O
tuesday O
morning O

but O
it O
was O
so O

Nothing O
on O

half O
hour O

the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
EVER O
, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
probably O

though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don O
' O
t O

Sit O
in O
the O
Balcony B-A

– O
Not O
bad O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
and O
appetizing O
. O

Portions B-A
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
, O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater O
. O

Fair O
menu B-A
selection I-A
. O

The O
appetizer B-A
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
the O
Creme B-A
Brulee I-A
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
. O

Indoor B-A
ambience I-A
was O
modern O
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
nice O
outside O
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O

It O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
people O

Although O
the O

could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O

in O
. O

Our O

kept O
coming O

our O
server B-A
came O
by O
a O

times O
. O

Should O
check O
- O
up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
, O
don O
' O
t O
you O
think O
? O

Late O
night O
dinning O
with O
exeptional O
food B-A
. O

– O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
go O
there O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
prices O
I O
saw O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
the O
table B-A
was O
private O
and O
nice O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
exceptional O
- O
sometime O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
army O
of O
friendly O
waiters B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
very O
good O
, O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
was O
probably O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
try O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
big O
though O
, O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much O
. O

Groovy O
music B-A
made O
the O
dinner O
casual O
. O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom B-A
which O
was O
odd O
. O

The O
bathroom B-A
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
bottles O
of O
perfume O
on O
the O
sink O
and O
the O
line O
of O
girls O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
sink O
. O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

This O
place B-A
rocks O
!! O

– O
Mercedes O
restaurant O
is O
so O
tasty O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
undeniably O
awesome O
! O

The O
chips B-A
and I-A
salsa I-A
are O
so O
yummy O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
fabulous O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
aspiring O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-A
is O
festive O
and O
amazing O
.. O

The O

out O
of O

Raouls B-A

Insultingly O

Mediocre O

Quality O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
replacestart B-A
Snooze I-A
replaceend O
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O
overpriced O
IHOP O
with O
a O
high O
brow O
menu B-A
. O

To O
start O
off O
, O
approximately O
8 O
- O
10 O
oz O
of O
orange B-A
juice I-A
will O
cost O
you O
$ O
3 O
. O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O
, O
skinny O
hour O
- O
glass O
shaped O
glass O
to O
disguise O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small O
replacestart B-A
juice I-A
replaceend O
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket O
. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-A
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
pancakes I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
were O
certainly O

On O

I O
rejected O
it O

in O
the O
process O

to O
fix O
the O

they O
broke O
something O

I O

To O

they O
removed O

the O

no O

a O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray B-A
' I-A
s I-A
Boathouse I-A
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

Ray O
' O
s O
is O
something O
of O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
, O
but O
given O
its O
gorgeous O
Sound B-A
views I-A
, O
I O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O
food O
and O
service O
. O

Imagine O
my O
happy O
surprise O
upon O
finding O
that O
the O
views B-A
are O
only O
the O
third O
- O
best O
thing O
about O
Ray B-A
' I-A
s I-A
! O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke B-A
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

My O
party O
of O
two O
was O
feeling O
particularly O
ambitious O
, O
and O
we O
splurged O
on O
the O
replacestart B-A
Shilshole I-A
Sampler I-A
replaceend O
... O
a O
beautiful O
assortment O
of O
enormous O
white B-A

, O
smoked O
albacore O

, O
Ray O
' O

fantastic O
manila B-A

seasoned O
with O

, O

in O
a O
tasty O

, O
and O
a O
tiny O
pile O
of O
Dungeness O
crab O
atop O
a O
sublime O
butter B-A
sauce I-A
. O

For O
my O
entr O
& O
eacute O
; O
e O
, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
replacestart B-A
seared I-A
Alaskan I-A

replaceend O
complemented O
by O
chard O
, O
artichoke O
hearts O
, O
fennel O
, O
and O
pecorino O
toscano O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
scallops I-A
replaceend O
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
). O

My O
friend O
enjoyed O
the O
grilled B-A
Alaskan I-A
King I-A
Salmon I-A
with O
delectable O
creamed B-A
Washington I-A
russet I-A
potatoes I-A
and O
crisp O
green B-A
beans I-A
. O

I O
had O
a O
taste O
of O
all O
three O
items O
on O
her O
plate B-A
, O
and O
they O
were O
superb O
. O

Our O
server B-A
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray B-A
' I-A
s I-A
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner O
? O

Two O
rascally O
kids O
were O
seated O
near O
us O
for O
the O
first O
part O
of O
our O
dinner O
... O
they O
were O
replaced O
by O
a O
delightful O
preteen O
who O
pretended O
to O
gag O
every O
time O
seafood O
was O
mentioned O
at O
her O
table O
. O

Given O
that O
Ray O
' O
s O
is O
a O
seafood O
restaurant O
... O
well O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
... O

All O
considered O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray B-A
' I-A
s I-A
Boathouse I-A
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
. O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O
server B-A
and O
food B-A
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
... O
the O
view B-A
was O
good O
, O
too O
. O
