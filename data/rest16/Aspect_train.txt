Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-A
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-A
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-A
tiny O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-A
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Saul B-A
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
duck B-A
confit I-A
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-A
gras I-A
terrine I-A
with I-A
figs I-A
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
wine I-A
list I-A
replaceend O
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-A
attendant I-A
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Food B-A
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

Chow B-A
fun I-A
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-A
shu I-A
mai I-A
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-A
again O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-A
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Service B-A
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-A
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
!!! O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-A
Saul I-A
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-A
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-A
breast I-A
special I-A
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
' O
give O
it O
a O
try O
.' O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
' O
ll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai B-A
fusion I-A
stuff I-A
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-A
Chicken I-A
special I-A
with I-A
Edamame I-A
Puree I-A
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
replacestart B-A
Edamame I-A
pureed I-A
replaceend O
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
' O
ve O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
). O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
' O
re O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-A
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-A
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
' O
s O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
' O
s O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

What O
' O
s O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

Their O
sake B-A
list I-A
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
wasn O
' O
t O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
spicy B-A
tuna I-A
roll I-A
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-A
shrimp I-A
tempura I-A
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-A
was O
great O
! O

we O
love O
th O
pink B-A
pony I-A
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot B-A
. O

Food B-A
- O
awesome O
. O

Service B-A
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Ambiance B-A
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
judge O
this O
place B-A
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
..) O

the O
food B-A
is O
decent O
. O

however O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
service B-A
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-A
intimidate O
me O
, O
i O
. O
e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
' O
m O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

well O
, O
i O
didn O
' O
t O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

This O
place B-A
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Food B-A
is O
great O
. O

Service B-A
is O
top O
notch O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-A
urchin I-A
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

The O
rice B-A
to I-A
fish I-A
ration I-A
was O
also O
good O
-- O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A
half I-A
price I-A
sushi I-A
deal I-A
replaceend O
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-A
impecable O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
' O
s O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
Prix I-A
Fixe I-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
). O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-A
were O
great O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-A
, O
chai B-A
, O
and O
the O
chole B-A
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-A
and O
dhal B-A
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

The O
service B-A
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
' O
re O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
kitchen B-A
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-A
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-A
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-A
and O
great O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

The O
lava B-A
cake I-A
dessert I-A
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-A
, O
you O
' O
re O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-A
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
replacestart B-A
French I-A
Onion I-A
soup I-A
replaceend O
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-A
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-A
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
pizza I-A
replaceend O
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-A
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients B-A
don O
' O
t O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-A
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-A
right O
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-A
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

The O
seafood B-A
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
good O
wine B-A
list I-A
, O
and O
the O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-A
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-A
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-A
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

And O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
replacestart B-A
fried I-A
shrimp I-A
replaceend O
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-A
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

The O
signs B-A
, O
the O
specials B-A
menus I-A
, O
food B-A
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-A
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
worth O
an O
one O
- O
hour O
drive O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

replacestart B-A
Leon I-A

East O

hip O

French B-A

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-A
Pomodori I-A
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B-A
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
service B-A
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-A
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-A
. O

You O
' O
ll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don O
' O
t O
compare O
. O

I O
' O
m O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-A
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

I O
just O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-A
, O
wine B-A
, O
and O
service B-A
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-A
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
while O
we O
waited O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-A
. O

The O
people B-A
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-A
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-A
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-A
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-A
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-A
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-A
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

Sauce B-A
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-A
didn O
' O
t O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
great O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
phenomenal O
! O

Service B-A
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Great O
pizza B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-A
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block B-A
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
..... O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-A
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
fantastic O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-A
of I-A
gari I-A
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

Planet B-A
Thailand I-A
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-A
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-A
food I-A
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-A
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
isn O
' O
t O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
' O
s O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It O
' O
s O
all O
about O
the O
food B-A
!! O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-A
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-A
, O
there O
weren O
' O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

those O
replacestart B-A
rolls I-A
replaceend O
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
fresh O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

Hurley O
' O
s O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-A
tuna I-A
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can O
' O
t O
get O
enough O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-A
terrace I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

The O
Steak B-A
Tartare I-A
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-A
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-A
kitchen I-A
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

Great O
wine B-A
selection I-A
, O
Gigondas B-A
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-A
champagne I-A
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-A
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-A
food I-A
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place B-A
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O
. O

the O
only O
pizza B-A

where O

Mother O

, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

Tiny O
replacestart B-A
dessert I-A
replaceend O
was O
$ O
8 O
. O
00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

The O
drinks B-A
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-A
selection I-A
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

Try O
their O
chef B-A
' I-A
s I-A
specials I-A
-- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Service B-A
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

Downstairs B-A
lounge I-A
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

Raga B-A
' I-A

The O

The O

. O

This O
is O
one O
of O

. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-A
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

Rude O
service B-A
, O
medicore O
food B-A
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
! O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-A
and O
actors B-A
. O

Our O
server B-A
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
too O
. O

The O
tuna B-A
and O
wasabe B-A
potatoes I-A
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
outdoor B-A
atmosphere I-A
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Service B-A
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
' O
ll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

Great O
service B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands O
- O
down O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
' O
s O
frequently O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-A
mozzarella I-A
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizza B-A
replaceendria I-A
' I-A
s I-A
. I-A

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-A
selection I-A
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-A
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-A
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O

restaurant O

Over O
100 O

A O
must O
try O
! O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-A
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

The O
chicken B-A
pot I-A
pie I-A
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
cheeseburger I-A
replaceend O
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-A
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid O
- O
town O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

The O
staff B-A
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

The O
food B-A
options O
rule O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-A
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-A
Ave I-A
spot I-A
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don O
' O
t O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
.) O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-A
Hand I-A
roll I-A
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
, O
the O

The O
sake B-A
menu I-A
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-A
teriyaki I-A
and O
the O
rose B-A
special I-A
roll I-A
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

Service B-A
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

Food B-A
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-A
belly I-A
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
). O

Wine B-A
list I-A
selection I-A
is O
good O
and O
wine B-A
- I-A
by I-A
- I-A
the I-A
- I-A
glass I-A
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

Traditional B-A
French I-A
decour I-A
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-A
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-A
Spice I-A
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-A
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Seating B-A
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Food B-A
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-A
vegatables I-A
in I-A
side I-A
orders I-A
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-A
- I-A
private I-A
boths I-A
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-A
Eye I-A
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-A
jazz I-A
band I-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
' O
s O
no O
need O
to O
. O

It O
' O
s O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-A
in O
NYC O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red B-A
Eye I-A
Grill I-A
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

The O
restaurant B-A
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-A
of I-A
herbs I-A
and I-A
tomatoes I-A
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
' O
s O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
hyde I-A
Pub I-A
last O
night O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-A
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
server B-A
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
place O
' O
s O
decor B-A
and O
hidden B-A
bathrooms I-A
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-A
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
Pub I-A
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-A
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-A
tortelini I-A
. O

The O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-A
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

The O
bagel B-A
was O
huge O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-A
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
). O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-A
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
replacestart B-A
lobster I-A
roll O
replaceend O
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-A
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-A
, O
santa B-A
fe I-A
chopped I-A
salad I-A
and O
fish B-A
and I-A
chips I-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart O
' O
s O
for O
their O
food B-A
, O
the O
ambience B-A
and O
wonderful O
service B-A
. O

All O
the O
staff B-A
is O
absolutely O
professional O
!! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don O
' O
t O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
...) O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O
. O

There O
' O
s O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
). O

This O
restaurant B-A
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

My O
chow B-A
fun I-A
and I-A
chow I-A
see I-A
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

Okay O
- O
i O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

The O
scallion B-A
pancakes I-A
and O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-A
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B-A
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-A
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

I O
definitely O
wouldn O
' O
t O
go O
back O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Their O
pad B-A
penang I-A
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-A
is O
poor O
. O

fresh B-A
restaurant I-A
was O
amazing O
........ O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
and O

great O
for O
a O

I O
will O
be O
going O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-A
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

the O
salads B-A
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-A
' I-A
s I-A
special I-A
fried I-A
fish I-A
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

Great O

, O
lots O
of O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O
. O

My O
husbands O

perfect O
, O
my O

and O
dry O
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-A
so O
much O
. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O
. O

Ambience B-A
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

Salads B-A
were O
fantastic O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-A
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

Ingredients B-A
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
replacestart B-A

replaceend O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside O
- O
out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
spicy I-A
Tuna I-A
roll I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-A
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
replacestart B-A
all I-A
you I-A
can I-A
eat I-A
deal I-A
replaceend O
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O

than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O

. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-A
I O
' O
ll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O

The O

reasonable O

no O
more O

$ O
3 O
- O
6 O

). O

The O
takeout B-A
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O

This O
place B-A

for O
a O
pasta B-A
dish I-A
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O

Yes O

the O

pizza I-A
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

The O
sangria B-A
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-A
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
' O
s O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
!) O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-A
beer I-A
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka O
- O
masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

MMmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-A
were O
friendly O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
nice O
place B-A
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

Pizza B-A
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-A
pasta I-A
. O

Ambience B-A
is O
delightful O
, O
service B-A
impeccable O
. O

I O
' O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-A
. O

The O
hanger B-A
steak I-A
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-A
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
' O
re O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-A
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
filet B-A
mignon I-A
dish I-A
was O
superb O
! O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-A
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B-A
!!! O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
it O
' O
s O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
is O
amazing O
!!! O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-A
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-A
and I-A
noodle I-A
soup I-A
dishes I-A
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

We O
won O
' O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-A
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place B-A
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-A
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

THe O
Pizza B-A
and O
wine B-A
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-A
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-A
dining I-A
area I-A
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

Check O
this O
place B-A
out O
! O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
!!!!! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-A
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
' O
s O
editorial O
review O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
' O
s O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

The O
tables B-A
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-A
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
replacestart B-A
wines I-A
replaceend O
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+. O

Service B-A
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
.... O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-A
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-A
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-A
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-A
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-A
or I-A
orange I-A
flavoring I-A
. O

Fish B-A
was O
overdone O

it O

the O

and O
I O
' O

to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-A
in O
Fornino O
' O

blows O
my O
families O

away O
. O

It O

room O
full O
of O
New O

enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-A
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-A
, O
not O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-A
England I-A
Chowder I-A
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-A
Bisque I-A
. O

I O
had O
Filet O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-A
salad I-A
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-A
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-A
branzino I-A
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
decor B-A
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-A
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-A
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Our O
food B-A
was O
great O
too O
! O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-A
. O

The O
staff B-A
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B-A
and I-A
Hyde I-A
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
characters B-A
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-A
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-A
and I-A
Hydes I-A
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

Service B-A
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Drinks B-A
way O
over O
priced O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Great O
pizza B-A

Service B-A

Zero O

I O
thought O
this O

was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
.... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O

The O
ambience B-A

nice O

wasn O
' O

so O
great O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
doesn O
' O

seem O

Thius O

for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu B-A
- I-A
Shabu I-A

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
nothing O
special O

but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

The O
owner B-A
and O
staff B-A
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O

that O
adds O
to O
the O

Despite O
a O

we O

not O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
! O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O

. O

We O
liked O

much O
, O
that O
we O

it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O

The O
location B-A
and O
ambience B-A
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-A
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O

There O
is O
a O

Moderate O

that O

Ciao O
Bella O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
, O
service B-A
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
authentic O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-A
choices I-A
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
NYC O
! O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B-A

Great O
staff B-A

Always O
great O
service B-A

Fantastic O
! O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
lie O
. O

But O
the O
staff B-A
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
and O
the O
waitress B-A
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-A
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

This O
place B-A
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-A
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-A
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

I O
' O
ll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

Amma B-A
is O
nothing O
special O

replaceend O
average O
at O

and O
too O
expensive O
. O

Will O
not O
be O

at O

Decor B-A

Haru B-A
on I-A
Park I-A
S I-A
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-A
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-A
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-A
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

the O
all B-A
- I-A
u I-A
- I-A
can I-A
- I-A
eat I-A
sushi I-A
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

limited O
menu B-A
, O
no O
- O
so O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-A
, O
thinly O
- O
sliced O
fish B-A
, O
fall O
- O
apart O
rice B-A
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-A
sauce I-A
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
), O
the O
vinegar O
- O
soaked O
rice B-A
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-A
are O
nice O
though O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth B-A
' I-A
s I-A
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-A
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

The O
dinner B-A
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-A
benedict I-A
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-A
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-A
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
. O

I O
look O

rude O
at O
times O

the O

, O
it O
' O
s O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Just O
because O
it O
' O

cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-A
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-A
is O
nasty O
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O
! O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

It O
' O

popular O
w O

the O

t O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
include O

didn O
' O
t O
come O
with O
anything O

a O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O

Eating O

the O

saves O
it O

at O
your O

it O
' O

although O

that O
price O
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-A
special I-A
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-A
), O
and O
the O
service B-A
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-A
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-A
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-A
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-A
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-A
. O

Why O
? O

They O
don O
' O
t O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
' O
s O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

please O
don O
' O
t O
fool O
us O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-A
fish I-A
, O
drunken B-A
chicken I-A
and O
the O
soupy B-A
dumplings I-A
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-A
fry I-A
blue I-A
crab I-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-A
are O
nice O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Have O
frequented O
' O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-A
remains O
excellent O
. O

The O

the O

Definitely O
a O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-A
!! O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
so O
great O

I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O

and O
the O

its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

The O

very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
' O
re O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-A
Noir I-A
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-A
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
!! O

The O
service B-A
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

The O
waitress B-A
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitress B-A
replaceending I-A
. I-A

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-A
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-A
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-A
Noir I-A
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-A
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Pizza B-A
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

Salads B-A
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-A
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Decor B-A
is O
charming O
. O

Service B-A
is O
average O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-A
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

The O
ambience B-A
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
' O
s O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-A
cuisine I-A
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-A
service I-A
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

A O
gentleman B-A
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
' O
s O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Never O
again O
! O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B-A
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-A
, O
delicious O
dishes B-A
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-A
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8 O
: O
30 O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B-A
, O
drinks B-A
, O
staff B-A
, O
mileau B-A
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-A
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-A
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-A
didn O
' O
t O
have O
my O
name O
. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-A
table I-A
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
staff I-A
replaceend O
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B-A
bathroom I-A
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-A
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-A
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-A
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-A
and O
fantastic O
service B-A
. O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B-A
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-A
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-A
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you O
' O
re O
with O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-A
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-A
dish I-A
I O
had O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-A
Mojito I-A
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-A
sum I-A
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-A
patio I-A
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
' O
s O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-A
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant B-A
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
good O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

but O
the O
service B-A
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
buffet B-A
had O
a O
nice O
selection O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-A
. O

Service B-A
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-A
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-A
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
' O
s O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-A
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-A
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-A
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did O
' O
nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-A
sandwich I-A
on I-A
a I-A
roll I-A
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami O
- O
but O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
much O
taste O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

This O
place B-A
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendstart O
food O
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-A
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-A
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-A
Kha I-A
soup I-A
was O
pathetic O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-A
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-A
. O

The O
pesto B-A
pizza I-A
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-A
Italian I-A
cheese I-A
that O
I O
' O
d O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

THe O
back B-A
garden I-A
sitting I-A
area I-A
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-A
sandwich I-A
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
' O
ve O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-A
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-A
fries I-A
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-A
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-A
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-A
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

love O
the O
food B-A
. O

it O
' O
s O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-A
comfort I-A
food I-A
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

and O
you O
can O
' O
t O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

highly O

I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O

years O
and O
this O

it O
all O
. O

Great O
food B-A
, O
good O
size O
menu B-A
, O
great O
service B-A
and O
an O
unpretensious O

The O
dishes B-A
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-A
sausages I-A
, O
sardines B-A
with I-A
biscuits I-A

I O
was O

to O
this O

this O
is O
a O

NY O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O

and O
Joya O
is O
the O

I O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O

when O
I O

actually O
claimed O
the O

was O
late O
because O
they O
were O

excellent O
service B-A

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-A
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-A
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
food B-A
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-A
Jamun I-A
( I-A
dessert I-A
) I-A
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-A
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
a O
table O
. O

Service B-A
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-A
was O
fantastic O
. O

Guacamole B-A
+ I-A
shrimp I-A
appetizer I-A
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-A
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-A
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet B-A
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;-) O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-A
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-A
place I-A
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-A
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
crust B-A
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-A
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-A
is O
friendly O
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

The O
menu B-A
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-A
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

All O
of O
the O
replacestart B-A
pizzas I-A
replaceend O
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia B-A
pizza I-A
. O

It O
' O
s O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
food B-A
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-A
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-A
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
' O
re O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-A
plus O
great O
service B-A
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
replacestart B-A
sushi I-A
replaceend O
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
I O
' O
ll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

The O
blond B-A
wood I-A
decor I-A
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B-A
sake I-A
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-A
is O
great O
. O

Mizu B-A
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-A
food I-A
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-A
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-A
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-A
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-A
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-A
! O

Thalia B-A
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-A
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-A
salmon I-A
and I-A
roe I-A
appetizer I-A
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
entree I-A
replaceend O
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B-A
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
replacestart B-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
. O

The O
view B-A
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
great O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-A
daiquiries I-A
as O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O

City O
! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Authentic O
replacestart B-A
Taiwanese I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
that O
' O
s O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
). O

The O
cold B-A
appetizer I-A
dishes I-A
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

delicious O
simple O
replacestart B-A

in O

outdoor B-A
atmosphere I-A
. O

Kind O
, O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O

and O
the O
mahi B-A
mahi I-A
( I-A
on I-A
saffron I-A
risotto I-A
- O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-A
and I-A
mashed I-A
potatos I-A
. O

Delicious O
crab B-A
cakes I-A
too O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-A
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B-A
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B-A

with O
good O
replacestart B-A
selection I-A
of I-A
thin I-A
crust I-A
pizza I-A
replaceend O
including O
the O
Basil B-A
slice I-A
. O

Their O
calzones B-A
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

The O
counter B-A
service I-A
is O
bad O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

They O
' O
re O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-A
33 I-A
for O
me O
! O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
dosas I-A
replaceend O
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
' O
d O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
' O
d O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
sandwiches I-A
replaceend O
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

Calling O

place B-A
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O
. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-A
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-A
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place B-A
kicks O
ass O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B-A
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
magnificant O
. O

Best O
Italian B-A
food I-A
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
). O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-A
to O
eat O
outside O

The O
restaurant B-A
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

It O
is O
set O

from O
the O
small O

it O
' O

and O
there O
is O
no O

. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-A
dishes I-A
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-A
are O
delicious O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-A
to O
take O
out O

of O

I O
will O
be O
out O

all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-A
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-A
spot I-A
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

The O
pizza B-A
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-A
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
). O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess O
- O
a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
cream B-A
cheeses I-A
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-A
!! O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Bagels B-A
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-A
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-A
!.. O

the O
turkey B-A
burgers I-A
are O
scary O
! O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-A
food I-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
encountered O
. O

The O
soup B-A
for I-A
the I-A
udon I-A
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

The O
sushi B-A
was O
awful O
! O

The O
rice B-A
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-A
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-A
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

The O
fish B-A
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-A

I O

as O
I O

got O
there O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O

) O

Winnie B-A
and O
her O
staff B-A
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-A
food I-A
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
' O
s O
of O
course O
). O

Try O
the O
Pad B-A
Thai I-A
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-A
menu I-A
... O
they O
' O
re O
all O
delicious O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-A
was O
special O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

The O
brioche B-A
and I-A
lollies I-A
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O
. O

I O
' O
m O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

The O
place B-A
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

Service B-A
was O
good O
and O
food B-A
is O
wonderful O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-A
and O
crab B-A
salad I-A
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-A
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-A
Strike I-A
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
- O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
wait B-A
staff I-A
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she O
' O
s O
- O
way O
- O
cuter O
- O
than O
- O
me O
- O
that O
- O
b O
@#$* O
way O
). O

The O
food B-A
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-A
in I-A
spicy I-A
tomato I-A
sauce I-A
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-A
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-A
night I-A
atmosphere I-A
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

You O

. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-A
. O

Suan B-A
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Its O
location B-A
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-A
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-A

noodles B-A
with I-A
shrimp I-A
and I-A
chicken I-A
and I-A
coconut I-A
juice I-A
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-A
soon O
! O

In O
summer O
- O
eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-A
( O
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O
)!!! O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-A
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-A
food I-A
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner O
location O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-A
and O
staff B-A
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

The O
food B-A
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-A
you O
' O
d O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
setting B-A
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
excellent O
! O

if O
you O
' O
re O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-A
vinegar I-A
over I-A

, O
it O
' O
s O
wonderful O
! O

Do O
not O
get O

, O
no O

what O
the O

They O

off O
($ O
8 O
. O

for O
four O
small O

and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

The O
rest O

the O

replaceend O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O

Steamed O

hot O

The O
wait B-A
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O

, O
but O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-A
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-A
cake I-A
, O
roast B-A
pork I-A
buns I-A
and O
egg B-A
custards I-A
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

( O

) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O

just O
south O
of O

( O

at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O

just O
south O

Canal O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
exceptional O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B-A
lamb I-A
shank I-A
in I-A
red I-A
wine I-A
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-A
was O
casual O
. O

The O
restaurant B-A
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-A

however O
the O

i O
would O
just O
ask O

next O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-A
House I-A
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
good O
. O

The O
fried B-A
dumplings I-A
are O
GREAT O
! O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-A
restaurant I-A
! O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O

service I-A
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O

. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O

- O
deserves O
to O

Never O

a O

. O

Service B-A
is O
fast O
and O

. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won O
' O
t O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O

. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O

, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-A
, O
well O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
' O
ll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Rao B-A
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
nothing O
special O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
' O
m O
eating O
indian B-A
cuisine I-A
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-A
appetizers I-A
. O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn O
' O
t O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-A
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-A
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O

at O
the O

also O
it O
' O

they O

I O

on O
the O

, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O

' O

for O
convenience O
. O

Their O
bagels B-A
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Better O
than O
the O

shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O

Great O

Drawbacks O

Out O
of O

the O
best O
. O

The O
shrimp B-A
scampi I-A
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-A
were O
plentiful O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

If O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O

( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O

The O
only O
thing O
the O

was O
very O
prompt O

was O
very O
good O

not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O

experience O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
porcini B-A
mushroom I-A

special I-A
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-A
tagliatelle I-A
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

But O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-A
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips O
- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-A

Everything O
I O

and O
I O
' O
m O
a O

We O
were O
less O

While O
the O
ambiance B-A
and O
atmosphere B-A
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
replacestart B-A
chicken I-A

were O
a O

I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-A
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

It O
just O
wasn O
' O
t O
Thai O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O

was O
expecting O
outstanding O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

Pizza B-A
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

Ravioli B-A
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
enough O
wines B-A
by I-A
the I-A
glass I-A
either O
. O

Service B-A
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O

Food I-A
replaceend O

... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

This O

I O
' O

The O
mussles B-A

the O
fishiest O

I O
' O

the O
seabass B-A

was O
surprisingly O
excellent O

The O

so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O

) O

I O
came O

with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
decor B-A
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
portions B-A
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-A
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-A
lasagna I-A
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-A
bread I-A

The O

gave O

happy O
with O

Great O

and O
the O

are O
very O
reasonable O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

The O
food B-A
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O

I O

with I-A
shrimp I-A
dumplings I-A
and I-A
slices I-A

This O
dish B-A
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-A
and O
the O

like O
deep O
fried O

out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
live O
in O
the O

, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O

Consistently O

Just O

to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-A
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-A
and O
a O
sushi B-A
chef I-A
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

Price O

Wasn O
' O
t O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-A
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O

. O

No O
thanks O
!!! O

This O
place B-A
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O

is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Fabulous O

Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
..... O
all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O
! O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
' O
d O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-A
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O

. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
need O
overpriced O
food B-A
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-A
- I-A
staff I-A
who O
don O
' O
t O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-A
, O
and O
management B-A
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
care O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-A
and O
I O
thought O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

They O
' O
re O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Baluchi B-A
' I-A
s I-A
has O
solid O
food B-A
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-A
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-A
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-A
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-A
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-A
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-A
you I-A
can I-A
eat I-A
sushi I-A
cannot O
be O
beaten O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-A
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-A
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20 O
' O
s O
/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

The O
vibe B-A
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-A
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
excellent O
! O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Food B-A
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-A
of I-A
the I-A
new I-A
york I-A
city I-A
skiline I-A
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O

Personal B-A

are O
the O
perfect O

for O
those O
hungry O
nights O

I O
heartily O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
' O
re O

in O
-- O
the O
delivery B-A
guys I-A
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O

Never O

it O

lobster B-A
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

its O
just O
a O

place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-A
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O

not O

this O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
can O
' O
t O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O

I O
thought O
the O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-A
alla I-A
marsala I-A
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

The O
veal B-A
and O
the O
mushrooms B-A
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

The O
potato B-A
balls I-A
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

I O
' O

at O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre O
- O
theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
). O

The O
wine B-A
list I-A
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff B-A
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

The O
bread B-A
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
" O
free O
" O
appetizer B-A
of I-A
olives I-A
was O
disappointing O
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-A
course I-A
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-A
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-A
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-A
torte I-A
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-A
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-A
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
replacestart B-A
location I-A
replaceend O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-A
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B-A
is O
great O
: O
it O
' O
s O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

The O
boths B-A
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
' O
re O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people O
. O

The O
service B-A
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive O
( O
thanks O
to O
the O
service B-A
button O
on O
your O
table O
) O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-A
took O
our O
order O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

over O
. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-A
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B-A
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
not O
the O
food B-A
. O

Will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

Impressed O
... O

Subtle O
food B-A
and O
service B-A

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-A
and O
food B-A
I O
enjoy O
. O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-A
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
' O
s O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-A
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-A
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-A
and O
bev B-A
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-A
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O

that O

Food B-A
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-A
dancing I-A
show I-A
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-A
is O
def O
worth O
commending O
! O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-A
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
menu B-A
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-A
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-A
sauce I-A
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
replacestart B-A
manager I-A
replaceend O
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
). O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
manager B-A
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
), O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-A
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-A
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B-A

. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B-A

and O
this O
spot O
delivers O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-A
of I-A
mirrors I-A

If O
you O
' O

when O
you O
' O
re O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O

then O
hey O
, O
that O
' O
s O
a O
good O
thing O

Despite O
the O
confusing O

this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O

to O

Indo B-A

good O
... O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-A
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-A
style I-A
Indian I-A
food I-A
. O

The O
chicken B-A
lollipop I-A
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-A
( O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
) O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-A
Chicken I-A
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-A
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
:) O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-A
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-A
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Rather O
than O

the O

I O
requested O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-A
were O
really O
good O
. O

The O
entree B-A
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O

the O

Surprised O

Just O

Some O

of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

replacestart B-A
The I-A
Four I-A
Seasons I-A
replaceend O
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
" O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
". O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-A
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-A
). O

The O
environment B-A
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-A
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-A
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

Service B-A
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money O
.. O
scammers O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-A
La I-A
Femme I-A
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
replacestart B-A
Casa I-A
La I-A
Femme I-A
replaceend O
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-A
for O
a O
table O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
place B-A
is O
beautiful O
! O

The O
hostess B-A
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
replacestart B-A
drinks I-A
replaceend O
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-A
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-A
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

My O
chicken B-A
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
replacestart B-A
dinner I-A
replaceend O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-A
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-A
was O
inedible O
! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
replacestart B-A
restaurant I-A
replaceend O
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
... O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6 O
: O
20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
" O
Wow O
that O
' O
s O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
together O
", O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
" O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
." O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

The O
menu B-A
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-A
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-A
of I-A
bottled I-A
beer I-A
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
replacestart B-A
fried I-A
oysters I-A
and I-A
clams I-A
replaceend O
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
). O

The O
replacestart B-A
lobster I-A
knuckles I-A
replaceend O
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
" B-A
salt I-A
encrusted I-A
shrimp I-A
" I-A
appetizer I-A
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O
' O
s O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

She O
replied O
" O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
." O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-A
style I-A
Fried I-A
Sea I-A
Bass I-A
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-A
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
replacestart B-A
grilled I-A
Mahi I-A
Mahi I-A
replaceend O
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-A
roll I-A
was O
excellent O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
). O

All O
in O
all O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

Service B-A
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
" O
large O
party O
"! O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

Great O
Indian B-A
food I-A

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Food B-A
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

Very O
" O
normal O
replacestart B-A
Indian I-A
food I-A
replaceend O
", O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-A
tikka I-A
masala I-A
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
), O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
rereplacestart O

replaceendstart O
place B-A
rereplacestart O
place O
replaceendend O
doesn O
' O
t O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-A
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-A
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
' O
s O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
). O

But O
if O
you O
' O
re O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B-A
an O
service B-A
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
' O
s O
order O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-A
fair I-A
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
' O
s O
your O
only O
option O
), O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-A
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
), O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-A
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-A
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

It O
wasn O
' O
t O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-A
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
' O
s O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

your O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi O
- O
bokum O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-A
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-A
bowl I-A
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-A
bowl I-A
. O

The O
nakgi B-A
- I-A
bokum I-A
was O
horrible O
. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-A
- I-A
fried I-A
squid I-A
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
tasted O
. O

The O
sauce B-A
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
side I-A
dishes I-A
replaceend O
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-A
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
wasn O
' O
t O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-A
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O

. O

Authentic O

Lives O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
around O
the O

from O
this O

for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn O
' O
t O
take O
reservations O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-A
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

It O
doesn O
' O
t O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
' O
s O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro B-A

the O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-A
of I-A
NYC I-A
pizza I-A
. O

The O
crust B-A
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-A
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-A
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-A

better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-A

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
replacestart B-A
modern I-A
Japanese I-A
brasserie I-A
replaceend O
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O

), O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-A
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-A
wooden I-A
doors I-A
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor B-A
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-A
booths I-A
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O

watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O

level O
that O
have O
glass B-A
ceilings I-A
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O

in O

It O
’ O
s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘ O
excuse O
me O
’ O
before O
the O
waiter B-A
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
replacestart B-A
BBE I-A
$ I-A
29 I-A
fixe I-A
prix I-A
menu I-A
replaceend O
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-A
amuse I-A
bouche I-A
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-A
Black I-A
Cod I-A
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-A
Salmon I-A
dish I-A
was O
better O
. O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

The O
sake B-A
’ I-A
s I-A
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-A
black I-A
sesame I-A
mousse I-A
( O
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
) O
and O
matcha B-A
( I-A
powdered I-A
green I-A
tea I-A
) I-A
and I-A
blueberry I-A
cheesecake I-A
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
replacestart B-A
brasserie I-A
replaceend O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
replacestart B-A
Zenkichi I-A
replaceend O
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

The O
service B-A
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

We O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
!! O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-A
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-A
adn O
their O

the O

the O

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

The O
food B-A
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

The O
family B-A
seafood I-A
entree I-A
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
main B-A
entree I-A
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
replacestart B-A
food I-A
replaceend O
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-A
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O

walls I-A
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored B-A
walls I-A
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

This O
place B-A
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-A
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-A
tapas I-A
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
doesn O
' O
t O
work O
. O

The O
food B-A
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O

place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O

Good O
Food B-A

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

The O
food B-A
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-A
space I-A
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Over O
all O
it O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O

area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-A
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-A
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-A
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
say O
the O
margaritas B-A
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Our O
waitress B-A
wasn O
' O
t O
mean O
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-A
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Regardless O
, O
we O
' O
ll O
be O
back O
and O
can O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-A
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind O
- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
servers B-A
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

A O
different O
server B-A
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-A
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
). O

Overall O
the O
food B-A
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
hasn O
' O
t O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit B-A
- I-A
out I-A
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B-A
and O
, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-A
list I-A
( O
I O
was O
given O
the O

when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O

however O
, O
this O

no O
way O

unless O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive O
- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
world O
- O
beater O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-A
still O
open O
? O

I O
honestly O
don O
' O
t O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-A
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-A
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-A
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de O
- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
replacestart B-A
salmon I-A
replaceend O
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
replacestart B-A
salmon I-A
replaceend O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-A
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress B-A
WALKED O
away O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach B-A
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-A
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
!!!! O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
" O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
" O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
!!!!!!!!!!!! O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
!!!!!! O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
: O
the O
manager B-A
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
comp O
it O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
!!!! O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

The O
manager B-A
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-A
and O
appetizers B-A
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-A
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O

Moving O

If O
I O
could O

I O
would O
do O

for O
this O

Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O

dining O
what O
Chuckie O

is O
to O
italian O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
can O
' O
t O
hide O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don O
' O
t O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
' O
s O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

This O
place B-A
... O
god O
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-A
i O
' O
ll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

The O
decor B-A
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
won O
' O
t O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
replacestart B-A
eggplant I-A
replaceend O
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
!!!! O

How O
this O
place B-A
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O

. O

Great O
Hot B-A
Dogs I-A
! O

I O
' O
ve O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
( O
I O
live O
on O
UWS O
). O

Though O
it O
' O
s O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-A
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-A
. O

The O
hot B-A
dogs I-A
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
' O
re O
Slamwich B-A
is O
amazing O
! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-A
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-A
. O

But O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot B-A
, O
great O
food B-A
. O

Fabulous O
food B-A
- O
if O
the O
front B-A
of I-A
house I-A
staff I-A
don O
' O
t O
put O
you O
off O
– O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
' O
ve O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
, O
the O
front B-A
of I-A
house I-A
staff I-A
( O
not O
the O
waiters B-A
- O
they O
' O
re O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-A
dishes I-A
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

As O
BFC B-A
doesn O
' O
t O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-A
of I-A
house I-A
staff I-A
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-A
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
" O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
?? O

I O
' O
d O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B-A
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

There O
' O
s O
another O
girl B-A
who O
I O
can O
' O
t O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5 O
' O
6 O
" O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
' O
re O

I O
' O
m O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
' O
d O
be O
super O
upset O

that O
were O
my O
employee O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O

$ O
60 O

head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-A

So O
, O
if O
you O

Maitre B-A
- I-A
D I-A
-" O
Eat O
and O
get O
out O
" O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

The O
food B-A
and O
service B-A
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-A
- I-A
D I-A
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-A
of I-A
wine I-A
, O
our O
son O
' O
s O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-A
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
: O
you O
can O
' O
t O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre B-A
- I-A
D I-A
' O
s O
sense O
of O
" O
table O
turnover O
", O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off O
- O
night O
. O

Best O
meal B-A
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

Mussles B-A
and O
calamari B-A
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-A
special I-A
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-A
steak I-A
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The B-A
Four I-A
Seasons I-A
restaurant I-A
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-A
is O
even O
better O
. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

Taking O
Hot B-A
Dogs I-A
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-A
dog I-A
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-A
you O
don O
' O
t O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-A
dog I-A
. O

Here O
the O
replacestart B-A
hot I-A
dog I-A
replaceend O
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

Great O
Atmosphere B-A

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-A
tacos I-A
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-A
, O
the O
fire B-A
place I-A
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

Poor O
service B-A
and O
management B-A

Don O
’ O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place B-A
! O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-A
la I-A
Femme I-A
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
manager B-A
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-A
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

The O
food B-A
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-A
or O
the O
wait B-A
for O
a O
table O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
... O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-A
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
don O
' O
t O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

Wow O
. O

The O
bread B-A
was O
stale O
, O
the O
replacestart B-A
salad I-A
replaceend O
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
replacestart B-A
replacestart I-A
pasta I-A
replaceend O
replaceend O
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

So O
rude O
!!! O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Her O
review O
is O
above O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
hostess B-A
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-A
disappeared O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-A
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-A
said O
, O
" O
can O
I O
help O
you O
" O
and O
" O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
." O

What O
? O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-A
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-A
service I-A
. O

bad O
staff B-A

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B-A
. O

The O
food B-A
is O
good O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-A
is O
good O
. O

But O
the O
service B-A
is O
HORRID O
! O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-A
and O
a O
waiter B-A
. O

The O
waiter B-A
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

The O
waitress B-A
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
). O

I O
couldn O
' O
t O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-A
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-A
. O
